V\u000a\u000a Biology is the science of life, specifically, the science of Earth's living systems, in all its times, present, past, and future, and in all its manifestations, from organisms to ecosystems to the biosphere; from artificial life to synthetic life, and to the possibility of extraterrestrial life.[2] Biologists study all aspects of Earth's living systems, including the origin of living systems from energy, abiotic matter, and information; their development and evolution; and, the dynamic processes operating within them, and those operating in interaction with their environment \u2014 all the characteristics that enable them to develop, survive, cognize, and reproduce. Those vital processes include: the harnessing, conversion, deployment and storage of energy and matter; self-organization of hierarchical dynamic networks and logic circuits through information processing mediated in part through supramolecular (non-covalent) interactions; the synthesis of the submicroscopic, microscopic and macroscopic structures of the body; homeostasis and homeodynamics; allostasis; hormesis; the self-healing of injuries; and, the reproduction of the organism, among many other activities, described in the article, Life.\u000a\u000aThe mysteries of living systems have fascinated all peoples throughout history, and curiosity about the physical nature and apparent relatedness of people, animals and plants exists in every known society. Some of that curiosity arises from a desire to control or influence life processes, as in medicine, and to exploit natural resources (e.g., plants and animals for food). Pursuit of the answers to biological questions has led to an understanding of organisms that has steadily improved our standard of living. Other questions come from a desire to understand nature, rather than to control it; and, in answering these, biological investigation has changed our view of the world and our place in it.\u000a\u000aThis introductory article focuses on biology as a formal science. Biologists formally employ the scientific method and the methods of theoretical biology and systems biology. They incorporate into their work the knowledge and methodologies of multiple disciplines, including mathematics, biophysics, chemistry, evolutionary principles, and many others.\u000a\u000aHow did life on earth begin? What physico-chemical characteristics separate something living from something dead or inanimate? What physico-chemical characteristics do all living share? How have living things, ranging from microscopic bacteria to towering trees, changed the earth's oceans, atmosphere and geology over time, and how have those changes in turn changed living things over time?\u000a\u000aThe scientific theories constructed as answers often conflict with religious doctrines. Some religious leaders have deplored the scientist's naturalistic mechanistic approach, because it removes the requirement for active intervention by a Creator. As biologists, physicians as early as the 5th century BCE, like Hippocrates of Cos, sought to explain human health and disease as having a natural mechanistic basis. Some modern scientists, such as Francis Crick, have welcomed biological explanations as providing a rational basis for the world, free of the need to invoke supernatural powers. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins (2006) sets out the secular humanist case in The God Delusion ISBN 9780058259. Others identify spiritual harmonies between the deep insights provided by science and those of religious thought. Intuitive concepts, such as, to use Dawkins' term, "Einsteinian religion", and the common intuition that animals have a "living essence", and humans a "soul", are not part of the direct scientific conception of modern biology. Yet intuitions about innate human behavior arguably foster the vigorous modern field of evolutionary psychology.[3] [4] Some view mathematical equations and the language of prophets as simply two different forms of human expression, each attempting to describe a higher dimension than that ordinary human experience.\u000a\u000aAlthough biology addresses fundamental issues about living things, it also addresses practical questions. The applications of biology have enabled the health sciences to become effective healing arts, and the world's food supply to become ever more plentiful and safe.\u000a\u000aThis article explores just a few selected themes; those themes center on the origin of life (both 'life on earth' and the creation of a new infant) and are followed through the centuries from ancient Greece to the present day. It is apparent that a philosophy of critical thinking, investigative methods that rely on empirical evidence, and the availability of technological tools have, together, accounted for how these ideas have changed. The development of biology has drawn on many more topics, and a much larger geographical area than referred to here. But the science of biology has a continuous thread through the centuries that began with the ancient Greek philosophers, and has generally followed the winding pattern of advancement presented here.\u000a\u000aPeople rely on plants and animals for sustenance, and Paleolithic cave paintings show that meticulously careful observations of prey have been expressed for at least tens of millennia. Human interest in food was not limited to passive considerations since, rather than eaten as found, it was carried from place to place and processed in various ways. In Neolithic times, probably somewhere in the fertile Nile delta, more 'planned' interactions with certain plants and their seeds led to the establishment of agriculture in many societies. When the intellectual consideration of what plants are was combined with experiments to understand their growth, then botany, the science of plants began.[5] Hippocrates of Cos and his followers, in their naturalistic approach to medicine, studied the effects of plants and plant products as medicinals. The Hippocratic Treatises advise: "Nature is the cure of illness. Leave thy drugs in the chemist\u2019s pot if thou can heal the patient with food." The tradition of Hippocratic medicine influenced the development of chemistry as well as botany. Biological study depends heaven on chemistry.\u000a\u000aAnatomy and zoology both date back to at least the 4th century BCE, and the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle.[6] In the first known book that discusses how life in the womb begins, Aristotle suggested that the mother provides the substance needed to create a new life, but that the father provides this base material with the essence of the child. He thought that the female's actual physical contribution to the baby was her menstrual blood, and that the male's corresponding contribution was his semen. Aristotle used logic and observation to arrive at his theory, which, in the main, was still accepted 2,000 years later. His conclusion that the woman's portion was the mere soil for the man's seed, and that the man's donation supplied all the essential humanity, was probably influenced by the assumption (in his society) that women were less highly developed than men. A popular idea that grew out of Aristotle's musings was that sperm contained a perfect miniature version of the new baby\u2014a homunculus. Ironically, we know now that in the strict biological realm, the mother supplies the child's first cell, filled with the structural and functional organization of a living cell, the oocyte, whereas the father supplies only a complementary set of chromosomes to those already in the oocyte. Some species of sexually reproducing species the female can produce offspring without the male's chromosomes, a process known as parthenogenesis.\u000a\u000aThe writings of the Greek scholars were preserved and cherished by the Romans, who added literature on the structure and function of animal and human bodies. The most influential of these was Galen, who was one of the most noted physicians in Rome. Galen performed public dissections and vivisections of animals, and used his findings to try to explain human illness. His writings survived the fall of Rome, and they formed a basis for the continuing advance of medicine.\u000a\u000aWith the Fall of Rome, many of the great Greek and Roman works were lost in Europe. Only a few survived, and few people could read them\u2014both the literature and the readers often cloistered together in religious orders. The University of Padua was one of the rare places in Europe where organized learning continued, and later, Padua was to become one of the seats of the Enlightenment. Arab writers, in contrast, continued the work that had been established in the Roman empire. Copies of the old manuscripts were made, and new books of empirically derived medical procedures and theory were written. Later, when the Moors invaded Europe, these books became available to scholars there.\u000a\u000aDuring the Renaissance, the authority of the 'classical' authors (such as Aristotle and Galen), and of religious doctrine (such as the teachings of the medieval Catholic Church), on the nature of living things began to be questioned in light of actual observation and experiment (the 'scientific method').\u000a\u000aBy the 17th century, the advantages of firm empirical evidence over the opinions of authorities were seen by such influential writers as Girolamo Fabrici of Italy and Francis Bacon of England (who coined the phrase knowledge is power). Rather than memorize the texts of Galen, or perform ritualized dissections as 'homage' to Galen's findings, the anatomy and physiology of animals began to be carefully explored in completely new directions. The early European biologists mapped the paths taken by the nerves and veins that traveled between organs, and analyzed their findings in an attempt to find general principles of the organization and function of the body.\u000a\u000aThe Englishman William Harvey studied how embryos develop by observations of hens' eggs and by dissecting pregnant deer and other mammals. He speculated that development proceeded from one to another of the fetal forms he found, imagining that each of these forms was a stage in a continuous process. Although other of his experiments famously revealed the circulation of the blood, and identified the workings of the heart as a pump, when it came to early development he failed to see any sort of rational explanation. He could not understand how discrete organs in the developing fetus could form out of the amorphous materials in the just pregnant womb or newly fertile egg. He chose a spiritual explanation, postulating that the soul of the new individual was derived from the placement of sperm in the female tract, invoking the gist of the old Aristotelian argument. Still, he modified Aristotle's explanation by insisting that the male and female contributions were equally important. He refuted the notion that the fetus is made up by the specific materials contributed by the male that grow because of the separate materials contributed by the female. Instead, he argued that "the material out of which the chick is formed in the egg is made at the same time it is formed" and that "out of the same material from which it is made, it is also nourished".[7]\u000a\u000aAs detailed examination of plant and animal species became common, and the knowledge was shared among people in many different parts of the world, similar arrangements of body structure were recognized in many different species. In the 18th century, the Swedish naturalist Carolus Linnaeus proposed a way of systematically classifying all living things. His method gives a unique name to each kind of plant and animal, and organizes them in a way that stresses similarities of physical features\u2014based on their comparative anatomy. This naming system is still used today, and every known species has a unique name that biologists all over the world recognize. The name has two parts: genus and species. The language is Latin, which was the common written language of scholars in Europe in Linnaeus' time. Human beings, for example, belong to the species Homo sapiens (Latin for 'wise man') under the family hominidae (the great apes).[8]\u000a\u000aAt first this system of classification did not include the idea that all living things were related. For more than a hundred years afterward, most highly educated thinkers assumed that complicated life forms (even mice!) could spring to life from a setting of inanimate objects (such as old rags and bread crumbs left in a dark corner). In the 19th century, Louis Pasteur showed that this common notion, spontaneous generation, was a fallacy. His work in bacteriology, along with that of Robert Koch, was important in establishing the germ theory of disease - a key turning point in the battle between man and the infectious diseases that were taking an increasing toll of human life.\u000a\u000aIn England, Charles Darwin showed how the idea of natural selection could explain how very diverse creatures share common underlying 'body patterns'. His observations of the variations of animal life on remote islands made him realize that individual birds, mammals and reptiles thrive, or die, according to how well their characteristics suit their particular habitat - and made him consider the inevitable consequences of that self-evident truth. He realized that individuals also differed in ways that made some more successful than others in producing offspring. If these differences were passed on to the offspring, then the features that made some individuals successful would become more common in each generation. From this insight, he made the bold leap to realize that, given enough time, new species might arise - and different new species might arise in different habitats. His theories became the key part of the theory of evolution, that all species now living on earth descended from species living in the past, most of which are now extinct. The existence of common ancestors explained why plants and animals form "groups" that share similar features : the very features that Linnaeus had used to formulate his categories in classification. The idea of evolution itself was not new, but it had been hard to understand how such incredibly diverse life forms could have come about by any natural mechanisms in the few thousand years that the world was thought to have existed. By Darwin's time, advances in Earth Science had found evidence that the earth was millions of years older than previously suspected, and this made the idea that organisms had evolved by many small,incremental changes over thousands of generations plausible. Evolutionary change from ancient life, by the mechanism of natural selection, came to be universally accepted by biologists as an immensely powerful and elegant theory that explained both the diversity of life, and the existence of patterns of common features.\u000a\u000aIn the late 19th century, an Austrian monk, Gregor Mendel, analyzed how traits were inherited from generation to generation in garden peas, and he concluded that the male and the female parent contribute equally. Instead of a fuzzy 'blending' of the characteristics of parents, Mendel saw that discrete traits of each individual were inherited intact, apparently based on a particulate 'binary system' of alleles that coded for the quality of each of them. A pea might be wrinkled or smooth, for example, and the particular pair of alleles inherited by each pea then determined what the next generation would be like. Mendel also saw that these alleles might be either 'dominant' or 'recessive'. Together, these ideas allowed Mendel to predict the proportion of offspring that would have each characteristic, and the field of genetics began.\u000a\u000aThe advance of biological thinking depended on communication, and on technology. The invention of the printing press facilitated the Enlightenment, and today, electronic communication has accelerated the rate of research. The availability of technical tools for experimentation has often been key to progress.\u000a\u000aThe features of plants and animals, for example, have been understood on an entirely different level with technological advances that provided new ways to study them. The microscope, modified by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in the 17th century, revealed details of structure in the bodies of organisms that had never before been suspected.\u000a\u000aOne of the new sights that van Leeuwenhoek described was individual ova and spermatozoa - the sperm cells he described as "animalcules", tiny animals in which he claimed to discern muscles and nerves [1]\u2014an example of even a great scientist perceiving his expectations, rather than what was really there. van Leeuwenhoek was a Creationist, who disputed the Aristotelian notion that living things could emerge from inanimate matter. He believed that the mother is an incubator for the "homunculus", inherited from the father, which was contained within the sperm cells (although he did not claim to have seen the homunculus itself under the microscope, as is often erroneously claimed).\u000a\u000aScience is always influenced by past ideas. No scientist can consider any hypothesis, or analyze any experimental results without using his or her mind, and all the blinkers and biases that come with it; however hard the good scientist tries to shake free and be objective, that mind is consciously and unconsciously stamped with the culture that produced it.\u000a\u000aNot only was the structure of flesh and plants seen in new detail with the microscope, but new types of organisms were also revealed: micro-organisms that could not be detected with the naked eye.[9] And so, like all important technological advances in biology, the microscope led to new ideas about living things. It was realized that tissues were composed of cells, the field of microbiology was born, and the ground was prepared for the germ theory of disease, an idea that helped bring the traditional practice of western medicine into the field of health science and modern medicine. Further developments led to the modern compound microscope by the end of the 19th century, with a much higher resolution allowing the visualization of dividing cells, and the chromosomes of the nucleus.\u000a\u000aCell biology began around 1900, with the discovery of the chromosomes and the understanding of mitosis and meiosis. Application of Mendel's fundamental laws of heredity to genetic linkage analysis allowed the correlation of specific plant or animal traits to be ordered as gene loci in the first genetic maps.[10] The culmination of this work and evidence from cytogenetics, led to the concept of genes as heritable traits that had a physical structure in the chromosomes; in the words of Thomas Morgan "...there is an ever increasing body of information that points clearly to the chromosomes as the bearers of the Mendelian factors, it would be folly to close one's eyes to so patent a relation."[11]\u000a\u000aTowards the mid-20th century, with the development of the electron microscope, ultra-high power examination of cells was possible and the field of cell biology began to unravel the inner structure of cells, discovering discrete organelles that could only be seen well at such high magnification. Closer examination of the structure of the cell was combined with the ability to separate the components of the cells by their density and chemical properties and analyze each fraction using methods from biochemistry and biophysics. Advances in this new field of cell biology confirmed that living things were composed of cell units and extended the understanding of just how cells carried out life processes.\u000a\u000aScience differs from religious and political dogmas in at least one major manner: its tenets are not 'sacred', but are always there to be questioned and tested. Thus over time, ideas have changed and many theories have been abandoned or disproved, including the homunculus theory of fetal development. With the resolving power of the electron microscopes, able to image cell structure at a magnification of tens of thousand-fold, that 'little man' inside the sperm cell vanished forever.\u000a\u000aIn the 20th century, the properties and roles of some of the large molecules (macromolecules) found in living things were examined. Proteins have three-dimensional shapes that give them special properties. Some proteins, known as enzymes, have specialized sites able to catalyze the chemical reactions critical for metabolism. Other proteins act as building blocks that make up the filaments that support the cytoplasm of cells, or lend such qualities as waterproofing to skin (keratin) or tensile strength to tendons (collagen). Proteins also provide an elaborately configured signaling network that guides responses to the environment. These sophisticated activities range from the selective transport of ions and food in and out of cells, to the ability of immune cells to recognize and attack foreign germs.\u000a\u000aAs protein sequences were compared between species, biologists appreciated a new variation on the old theme that research in comparative anatomy had raised three hundred years before. First, recurring anatomical patterns had been recognized, like the arrangement of bones in a bat's wing, a seal's flipper and a man's arm; and later, the molecular structures and shapes of the various families of proteins were recognized to be similar. The amino acid sequences within the protein families even show similarities between kingdoms like bacteria and animals, confirming that all living things are related.\u000a\u000aBy 1953, the painstaking x-ray studies of Rosalind Franklin allowed the imagination of James Watson and Francis Crick to seize upon the structure of DNA.[12] The double helix structure of that molecule revealed how information might be coded and passed from generation to generation, by showing how the DNA molecule could act as a 'template' for the synthesis of both itself, and a related molecule, RNA. Crick and others went on to propose that small RNA molecules might serve as adaptors that could be made from such a template, and be used to assemble amino acids to build proteins.\u000a\u000aWith these advances in organic chemistry, biochemistry and molecular biology, a new view of the origin of life forms on earth emerged. "It is now widely believed that almost four billion years ago, before the first living cells, life consisted of assemblies of self-reproducing macromolecules".[13]\u000a\u000aStudying the biochemistry of RNA and proteins involved purifying unstable compounds from sources that also contained enzymes for their breakdown. Work advanced, but successful experiments required labor-intensive manipulations that could take several days in refrigerated 'cold rooms', without substantial delay between steps. Consequently, unraveling the movement of RNA out of the nucleus to the endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes, and pinpointing the mechanics of how proteins were assembled in the cell, were heroic enterprises requiring marathon procedures (often performed by scientists dressed in parkas!).\u000a\u000aAttention turned to the DNA sequences that coded for proteins, and the genetic traits that Mendel had observed in his peas were found to have physical correlates in the genes that these sequences provided. By the end of the 20th century, the technique of PCR conceived by Kary Mullis allowed experiments on tiny samples of DNA to be done very efficiently, and progress in molecular biology accelerated. Superfamilies of genes were found in different organisms that underlay the existence of those families of related proteins that were identified in diverse tissues and diverse species.\u000a\u000aUnderstanding the ultrastructure of cells along with the chemical and physical properties of the organelles brought more new ideas to biology. Mitochondria are tiny organelles found in almost all cells, and these are the factories that produce energy for the cell. Mitochondria have their own DNA, but their form is more similar to those of bacteria rather than mammalian cells. These observations led Lynn Margulis to advocate an outlandish hypothesis for the origin of mitochondria being derived from bacteria assimilated into eukaryotic cells. Her endosymbiotic theory was finally published after being "rejected by about fifteen scientific journals",[14] but is widely accepted today. These energy-producing organelles of animal cells are not the only organelles found that derived from a different life form; the chloroplasts of plant cells are another.\u000a\u000aThe age-old question of how a new baby came to be born of man and woman took equally unexpected turns. The single cell from which every human develops does not receive equal genetic contributions from mother and father, after all. Each individual human being is made up of cells which obtain mitochondria and their mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) exclusively from the mother.\u000a\u000aEven genes in the nucleus of germ cells (egg and sperm) do not always act identically in the newly fertilized egg. Some genes are marked in the germ cells to be either active or inactive in the new embryo, by the addition of chemical modifiers to the DNA. This imprinting of genes by parental origin is another asymmetry that had been unsuspected. Oddly, this confirmed some of the suspicions of Aristotle after all, but in the opposite way to that imagined by the ancients. "Genes expressed from the paternally inherited copy generally increase resource transfer to the child, whereas maternally expressed genes reduce it."[15] In other words, the genetic material provided by the father has a role slanted to provide nourishment to the fetus whereas the same genes, when inherited through the mother, act differently. The placenta grows from the same fertilized egg that builds the baby, and nourishes the new infant from the mother's womb\u2014but it is the father's genes that are more important for the placental membrane's success in obtaining nutrients. It is as though there is a 'battle' between the father's genes and the mother's genes\u2014as if the father's genes want the biggest baby possible, while the mother's genes want a small baby to protect the mother.[16]\u000a\u000aBy the end of the 20th century, progress in molecular biology had given rise to the 'human genome project', an ambitious vision to determine the nucleotide sequence the DNA of every human gene. That vast project drew on the inputs of hundreds of scientists in many different countries, and saw completion ahead of schedule.[17] That unexpected speed was another of technology's boons to biology.\u000a\u000aSo, in 2006, we can map out how chromosomes have evolved across species, as well as use these genomic resources to trace our own distant ancestry back to the enigmatic traces of a preceding world.[18] Biologists may have once predicted that reaching this level of understanding would open up the answers to some of our deepest questions about life. However, for all the advances that have been made over the centuries, biology has only begun to clarify the living world. The genome projects, far from settling all uncertainties, have raised a whole new set of questions. One of the biggest surprises was the realization of how few genes underpin a human being\u2014just 28,000 or so, not many more than underpin simple animals, and fewer than the number of genes in many plants.\u000a\u000aWe have learned that simply identifying the sequence of nucleotides in DNA does not suffice to reveal the informational constitution of a human living system. Biologists must go beyond DNA sequences and start the process of understanding all the ways that genes interact at the level of whole plants and animals, and all the ways of 'epigenetic' mechanisms of function and inheritance. Systems biologists, who aim to develop models (or representations) of whole organisms, their organ systems, and the larger categories (e.g., species, ecosystems), in which the individual organism is only a part, are becoming increasingly important. And so we come full circle, again relying on the more traditional fields of biology to probe the secrets that are not apparent from focusing only on molecular information. This circular route may not have solved the riddle of life, but it has advanced our knowledge tremendously rather than returning us to the start.\u000a\u000aBiology will need new mathematics to reveal the working of living systems. "Biology will increasingly stimulate the creation of qualitatively new realms of mathematics. Why? In biology, ensemble properties emerge at each level of organization from the interactions of heterogeneous biological units at that level and at lower and higher levels of organization (larger and smaller physical scales, faster and slower temporal scales). New mathematics will be required to cope with these ensemble properties and with the heterogeneity of the biological units that compose ensembles at each level."[19]\u000a\u000aSadly, with science literacy declining in the United States in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, biology literacy has declined in parallel. Andrew Knoll, professor of natural history at Harvard's Earth and Planetary Sciences Department is quoted as saying: "The average adult American today knows less about biology than the average ten-year-old living in the Amazon, or than the average American of two hundred years ago."[20]\u000a\u000aAs quantitative methods continue to penetrate the workflows of biologists and professionals in neighbouring fields, the character of biology will change. Further changes can be expected from the wider use of web-based science communication, which allows to perform more and more steps of scientific research in the open. This includes participation of the public as well as the sharing of data, of the scientific literature and of background knowledge (as provided by wiki articles like this one), thoughts, ideas and comments on the process in a way that is much more elaborate than what we have seen so far.\u000a\u000aThe science of biology itself, even with the collaboration of the other natural sciences, cannot provide answers to questions of biological nature that arise in the minds of both the scientific community and the public.[21] Scientific methodologies have no approaches to answer such questions as:\u000a\u000aSuch questions, among many more, biology leaves to philosophers, including philosophers who themselves qualify as biologists or scientists who specialize in other disciplines.\u000a\u000aPhilosophy antedated science, then incorporated science as natural philosophy. Gradually, scientific disciplines split off from philosophy, leaving questions behind, and inspiring new questions, that remained the purview of philosophy.[21]

sS'Led Zeppelin site:wikipedia.org'
p3
VLed Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The band consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The group's heavy, guitar-driven sound, rooted in blues on their early albums, has drawn them recognition as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music.\u000a\u000aAfter changing their name from the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that afforded them considerable artistic freedom. Although the group was initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with albums such as Led Zeppelin (1969), Led Zeppelin II (1969), Led Zeppelin III (1970), their untitled fourth album (1971), Houses of the Holy (1973), and Physical Graffiti (1975). Their fourth album, which features the track "Stairway to Heaven", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it helped to cement the popularity of the group.\u000a\u000aPage wrote most of the music in Led Zeppelin's early career, while Plant generally supplied the songs' lyrics. Jones' keyboard-based compositions later became central to the group's music, and their later albums featured greater experimentation. The latter half of the band's career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned them a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their output and touring schedule were limited in the late 1970s, and the group disbanded following Bonham's death from alcohol-related asphyxia in 1980. In the decades since, the surviving members have sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off Led Zeppelin reunions. The most successful of these was at the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London, with Jason Bonham taking his late father's place behind the drums.\u000a\u000aLed Zeppelin are widely considered one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in history. They are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording; various sources estimate the group's record sales at 200 to 300 million units worldwide. With 111.5 million RIAA-certified units, they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums placed on the Billboard Top 10 and six reached the number-one spot. Rolling Stone magazine described them as "the heaviest band of all time", "the biggest band of the '70s" and "unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history". They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995; the museum's biography of the band states that they were "as influential in that decade [the 1970s] as the Beatles were in the prior one".\u000a\u000aIn 1966, London-based session guitarist Jimmy Page joined the blues-influenced rock band The Yardbirds to replace bassist Paul Samwell-Smith. Page soon switched from bass to lead guitar, creating a dual lead guitar line-up with Jeff Beck. Following Beck's departure in October 1966, the Yardbirds, tired from constant touring and recording, began to wind down. Page wanted to form a supergroup with him and Beck on guitars, and the Who's Keith Moon and John Entwistle on drums and bass. Vocalists Steve Winwood and Steve Marriott were also considered for the project. The group never formed, although Page, Beck and Moon did record a song together in 1966, "Beck's Bolero", in a session that also included bassist-keyboardist John Paul Jones.\u000a\u000aThe Yardbirds played their final gig in July 1968 at Luton College of Technology in Bedfordshire. They were still committed to several concerts in Scandinavia, so drummer Jim McCarty and vocalist Keith Relf authorised Page and bassist Chris Dreja to use "the Yardbirds" name to fulfill the band's obligations. Page and Dreja began putting a new line-up together. Page's first choice for the lead singer was Terry Reid, but Reid declined the offer and suggested Robert Plant, a singer for the Band of Joy and Hobbstweedle. Plant eventually accepted the position, recommending former Band of Joy drummer John Bonham. Jones inquired about the vacant position at the suggestion of his wife after Dreja dropped out of the project to become a photographer. He would later take the photograph that appeared on the back of Led Zeppelin's debut album. Page had known Jones since they were both session musicians and agreed to let him join as the final member.\u000a\u000aThe four played together for the first time in a room below a record store on Gerrard Street in London. Page suggested that they attempt "Train Kept A-Rollin'", originally a jump blues song popularised in a rockabilly version by Johnny Burnette, which had been covered by the Yardbirds. "As soon as I heard John Bonham play", Jones recalled, "I knew this was going to be great ... We locked together as a team immediately". Before leaving for Scandinavia, the group took part in a recording session for the P.J. Proby album, Three Week Hero. The album's track "Jim's Blues", with Plant on harmonica, was the first studio track to feature all four future members of Led Zeppelin.\u000a\u000aThe band completed the Scandinavian tour as the New Yardbirds, playing together for the first time in front of a live audience at Gladsaxe Teen Clubs in Gladsaxe, Denmark, on 7 September 1968. Later that month, they began recording their first album, which was based on their live set. The album was recorded and mixed in nine days, and Page himself covered the costs. After the album's completion, the band were forced to change their name after Dreja issued a cease and desist letter, stating that Page was only allowed to use the New Yardbirds moniker for the Scandinavian dates. One account of how the new band's name was chosen held that Moon and Entwistle had suggested that a supergroup with Page and Beck would go down like a "lead balloon", an idiom for disastrous results. The group dropped the 'a' in lead at the suggestion of their manager, Peter Grant, so that those unfamiliar with the term would not pronounce it "leed". The word "balloon" was swapped for "zeppelin", a word which, according to music journalist Keith Shadwick, brought "the perfect combination of heavy and light, combustibility and grace" to Page's mind.\u000a\u000aGrant secured a $143,000 advance contract from Atlantic Records in November 1968, which was then the biggest deal of its kind for a new band. Atlantic were a label with a catalogue of mainly blues, soul and jazz artists, but in the late 1960s they began to take an interest in British progressive rock acts. Record executives signed Led Zeppelin without having ever seen them. Under the terms of their contract, the band had autonomy in deciding when they would release albums and tour, and had the final say over the contents and design of each album. They would also decide how to promote each release and which tracks to release as singles. They formed their own company, Superhype, to handle all publishing rights.\u000a\u000aThe band began their first tour of the UK on 4 October 1968, still billed as the New Yardbirds, and played their first show as Led Zeppelin at the University of Surrey in Battersea on 25 October. Tour manager Richard Cole, who would become a major figure in the touring life of the group, organised their first North American tour at the end of the year. The first show was in Denver on 26 December 1968, followed by other West Coast dates before the band travelled to California to play Los Angeles and San Francisco. Their debut album, Led Zeppelin, was released in the US during the tour on 12 January 1969, and peaked at number 10 on the Billboard chart; it was released in the UK, where it peaked at number 6, on 31 March. According to Steve Erlewine, the album's memorable guitar riffs, lumbering rhythms, psychedelic blues, groovy, bluesy shuffles and hints of English folk, made it "a significant turning point in the evolution of hard rock and heavy metal".\u000a\u000aIn their first year, Led Zeppelin completed four US and four UK concert tours, and also released their second album, Led Zeppelin II. Recorded almost entirely on the road at various North American studios, it was an even greater commercial success than their first album, and reached the number one chart position in the US and the UK. The album further developed the mostly blues-rock musical style established on their debut release, creating a work with a sound that was "heavy and hard, brutal and direct", and which would be highly influential and frequently imitated. Steve Waksman has suggested that Led Zeppelin II was "the musical starting point for heavy metal".\u000a\u000aThe band saw their albums as indivisible, complete listening experiences, disliking the re-editing of existing tracks for release as singles. Grant maintained an aggressive pro-album stance, particularly in the UK, where there were few radio and TV outlets for rock music. Without the band's consent, however, some songs were released as singles, particularly in the US. In 1969 an edited version of "Whole Lotta Love", a track from their second album, was released as a single in the US. It reached number four in the Billboard chart in January 1970, selling over one million copies and helping to cement the band's popularity. The group also increasingly shunned television appearances, citing their preference that their fans hear and see them in live concerts.\u000a\u000aFollowing the second album's release, Led Zeppelin completed several more US tours. They played initially in clubs and ballrooms, and then in larger auditoriums as their popularity grew. Some early Led Zeppelin concerts lasted more than four hours, with expanded and improvised live versions of their repertoire. Many of these shows have been preserved as bootleg recordings. It was during this period of intensive concert touring that the band developed a reputation for off-stage excess. One alleged example of such extravagance was the shark episode said to have taken place at the Edgewater Inn in Seattle on 28 July 1969.\u000a\u000aIn 1970 Page and Plant retired to Bron-Yr-Aur, a remote cottage in Wales, to commence work on their third album, Led Zeppelin III. The result was a more acoustic style that was strongly influenced by folk and Celtic music, and showcased the band's versatility. The album's rich acoustic sound initially received mixed reactions, with critics and fans surprised at the turn from the primarily electric arrangements of the first two albums, further fuelling the band's hostility to the musical press. It reached number one in the UK and US charts, but its stay would be the shortest of their first five albums. The album's opening track, "Immigrant Song", was released as a US single in November 1970 against the band's wishes, reaching the top twenty on the Billboard chart.\u000a\u000aIn the 1970s Led Zeppelin reached new heights of commercial and critical success that made them one of the most influential groups of the era, dwarfing their earlier achievements. The band's image also changed as the members began to wear elaborate, flamboyant clothing. Led Zeppelin began travelling in a private jet airliner, a Boeing 720, (nicknamed the Starship), rented out entire sections of hotels (including the Continental Hyatt House in Los Angeles, known colloquially as the "Riot House"), and became the subject of frequently repeated stories of debauchery. One involved John Bonham riding a motorcycle through a rented floor of the Riot House, while another involved the destruction of a room in the Tokyo Hilton, leading to the group being banned from that establishment for life. Although Led Zeppelin developed a reputation for trashing their hotel suites and throwing television sets out of the windows, some suggest that these tales have been exaggerated. Music journalist Chris Welch argues that "[Led Zeppelin's] travels spawned many stories, but it was a myth that [they] were constantly engaged in acts of wanton destruction and lewd behaviour".\u000a\u000aLed Zeppelin released their fourth album on 8 November 1971. In response to the treatment the band had received from critics, particularly after Led Zeppelin III, the band decided to release the fourth album with no title, though it is variously referred to as Led Zeppelin IV, Untitled, IV, or, due to the four symbols appearing on the record label, as Four Symbols, Zoso or Runes. In addition to lacking a title, the original cover featured no band name, as the group wished to be anonymous and to avoid easy pigeonholing by the press. With 37 million copies sold, Led Zeppelin IV is one of the best-selling albums in history, and its massive popularity cemented Led Zeppelin's status as superstars in the 1970s. By 2006, it had sold 23 million copies in the United States alone. The track "Stairway to Heaven", never released as a single, is sometimes quoted as being the most requested and most played album-orientated rock (AOR) FM radio song. The group followed up the album's release with tours of the UK, Australasia, North America, Japan, and the UK again from late 1971 through early 1973.\u000a\u000aLed Zeppelin's next album, Houses of the Holy, was released in March 1973. It featured further experimentation by the band, who expanded their use of synthesisers and mellotron orchestration. The predominately orange album cover, designed by the London-based design group Hipgnosis, depicts images of nude children climbing the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Although the children are not shown from the front, the cover was controversial at the time of the album's release. As with the band's fourth album, neither their name nor the album title was printed on the sleeve.\u000a\u000aHouses of the Holy topped charts worldwide, and the band's subsequent concert tour of North America in 1973 broke records for attendance, as they consistently filled large auditoriums and stadiums. At Tampa Stadium in Florida, they played to 56,800 fans, breaking the record set by the Beatles' 1965 Shea Stadium concert and grossing $309,000. Three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City were filmed for a motion picture, but the theatrical release of this project (The Song Remains the Same) was delayed until 1976. Before the final night's performance, $180,000 of the band's money from gate receipts was stolen from a safe deposit box at the Drake Hotel.\u000a\u000aIn 1974, Led Zeppelin took a break from touring and launched their own record label, Swan Song, named after an unreleased song. The record label's logo, based on a drawing called Evening: Fall of Day (1869) by William Rimmer, features a picture of Apollo. The logo can be found on Led Zeppelin memorabilia, especially t-shirts. In addition to using Swan Song as a vehicle to promote their own albums, the band expanded the label's roster, signing artists such as Bad Company, the Pretty Things and Maggie Bell. The label was successful while Led Zeppelin existed, but folded less than three years after they disbanded.\u000a\u000aIn 1975, Led Zeppelin's double album Physical Graffiti was their first release on the Swan Song label. It consisted of fifteen songs, of which eight had been recorded at Headley Grange in 1974 and seven had been recorded earlier. A review in Rolling Stone magazine referred to Physical Graffiti as Led Zeppelin's "bid for artistic respectability", adding that the only bands Led Zeppelin had to compete with for the title "The World's Best Rock Band" were the Rolling Stones and the Who. The album was a massive fiscal and critical success. Shortly after the release of Physical Graffiti, all previous Led Zeppelin albums simultaneously re-entered the top-200 album chart, and the band embarked on another North American tour, now employing sophisticated sound and lighting systems. In May 1975, Led Zeppelin played five sold-out nights at the Earls Court Arena in London, at the time the largest arena in Britain.\u000a\u000aFollowing their triumphant Earls Court appearances, Led Zeppelin took a holiday and planned an autumn tour in America, scheduled to open with two outdoor dates in San Francisco. In August 1975, however, Plant and his wife Maureen were involved in a serious car crash while on holiday in Rhodes, Greece. Plant suffered a broken ankle and Maureen was badly injured; a blood transfusion saved her life. Unable to tour, he headed to the Channel Island of Jersey to spend August and September recuperating, with Bonham and Page in tow. The band then reconvened in Malibu, California. During this forced hiatus much of the material for their next album, Presence, was written.\u000a\u000aBy this time, Led Zeppelin were the world's number one rock attraction, having outsold most bands of the time, including the Rolling Stones. Presence, released in March 1976, marked a change in the Led Zeppelin sound towards more straightforward, guitar-based jams, departing from the acoustic ballads and intricate arrangements featured on their previous albums. Though it was a platinum seller, Presence received a mixed reaction among fans and the music press, with some critics suggesting that the band's excesses may have caught up with them. Page had begun using heroin during recording sessions for the album, a habit which may have affected the band's later live shows and studio recordings the band, although this has been denied by Page.\u000a\u000aBecause of Plant's injuries, Led Zeppelin did not tour in 1976. Instead, the band completed the concert film The Song Remains the Same and the accompanying soundtrack album. The film premiered in New York City on 20 October 1976, but was given a lukewarm reception by critics and fans. The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where, unwilling to tour since 1975 because of their tax exile status, Led Zeppelin faced an uphill battle to recapture the public's affection.\u000a\u000aIn 1977, Led Zeppelin embarked on another major concert tour of North America. The band set another attendance record, with an audience of 76,229 at their Silverdome concert on 30 April. It was, according to the Guinness Book of Records, the largest attendance to that date for a single act show. Although the tour was financially profitable, it was beset by off-stage problems. On 19 April, over 70 people were arrested as about 1,000 fans tried to gatecrash Cincinnati Riverfront Coliseum for two sold-out concerts, while others tried to gain entry by throwing rocks and bottles through glass doors. On 3 June, a concert at Tampa Stadium was cut short because of a severe thunderstorm, despite tickets indicating "Rain or Shine". A riot broke out, resulting in arrests and injuries.\u000a\u000aAfter the 23 July show at the Day on the Green festival at the Oakland Coliseum in Oakland, California, Bonham and members of the band's support staff were arrested after a member of promoter Bill Graham's staff was badly beaten during the band's performance. The following day's second Oakland concert was the band's final live appearance in the United States. Two days later, as the band checked in at a French Quarter hotel for their 30 July performance at the Louisiana Superdome, Plant received news that his five-year-old son, Karac, had died from a stomach virus. The rest of the tour was immediately cancelled, prompting widespread speculation about the band's future.\u000a\u000aIn November 1978 the group recorded at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The resulting album, In Through the Out Door, featured sonic experimentation that again drew mixed reactions from critics. Nevertheless, the album reached number one in the UK and the US in just its second week of release. With this album's release, Led Zeppelin's entire catalogue returned to the Billboard Top 200 in the weeks of 27 October and 3 November 1979.\u000a\u000aIn August 1979, after two warm-up shows in Copenhagen, Led Zeppelin headlined two concerts at the Knebworth Music Festival, playing to a crowd of approximately 104,000 on the first night. A brief, low-key European tour was undertaken in June and July 1980, featuring a stripped-down set without the usual lengthy jams and solos. On 27 June, at a show in Nuremberg, Germany, the concert came to an abrupt halt in the middle of the third song, when Bonham collapsed onstage and was rushed to hospital. Speculation in the press suggested that his collapse had been the result of excessive alcohol and drug use, but the band claimed that he had simply overeaten.\u000a\u000aA North American tour, the band's first since 1977, was scheduled to commence on 17 October 1980. On 24 September, Bonham was picked up by Led Zeppelin assistant Rex King to attend rehearsals at Bray Studios. During the journey, Bonham asked to stop for breakfast, where he downed four quadruple vodkas (450 ml/15 oz.), with a ham roll. After taking a bite of the ham roll he said to his assistant, "breakfast". He continued to drink heavily after arriving at the studio. The rehearsals were halted late that evening and the band retired to Page's house\u2014the Old Mill House in Clewer, Windsor. After midnight, Bonham, who had fallen asleep, was taken to bed and placed on his side. At 1:45 pm the next day, Benji LeFevre (Led Zeppelin's new tour manager) and John Paul Jones found Bonham dead. The cause of death was asphyxiation from vomit; an autopsy found no other drugs in his body. Bonham was cremated on 10 October 1980, and his ashes were buried at Rushock Parish Church in Droitwich, Worcestershire. A verdict of accidental death was returned at an inquest held on 27 October.\u000a\u000aThe planned North American tour was cancelled, and despite rumours that Cozy Powell, Carmine Appice, Barriemore Barlow, Simon Kirke or Bev Bevan would join the group as his replacement, the remaining members decided to disband. A 4 December 1980 press statement stated that, "We wish it to be known that the loss of our dear friend, and the deep sense of undivided harmony felt by ourselves and our manager, have led us to decide that we could not continue as we were". The statement was signed simply "Led Zeppelin".\u000a\u000aFollowing the dissolution of Led Zeppelin, the first significant project for the band members was the Honeydrippers, which Plant formed in 1981. The group featured Page on lead guitar, along with studio musicians and friends of Plant and Page, including Jeff Beck, Paul Shaffer, and Nile Rodgers. Plant focused the band in a different direction from Led Zeppelin, playing standards and in a more R&B style, highlighted by their cover of "Sea of Love", which peaked at number three on the Billboard charts in early 1985.\u000a\u000a1982 saw the release of Coda, a collection of outtakes and unused tracks from the band's career. It included two tracks taken from the band's performance at the Royal Albert Hall in 1970, one each from the Led Zeppelin III and Houses of the Holy sessions, and three from the In Through the Out Door sessions. It also featured a 1976 Bonham drum instrumental with electronic effects added by Page, called "Bonzo's Montreux".\u000a\u000aOn 13 July 1985, Page, Plant and Jones reunited for the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia, playing a short set featuring drummers Tony Thompson and Phil Collins and bassist Paul Martinez. Collins had contributed to Plant's first two solo albums while Martinez was a member of Plant's group Band of Joy. The performance was marred by the lack of rehearsal with the two drummers, Page's struggles with an out-of-tune guitar, poorly functioning monitors, and by Plant's hoarse voice. Page described the performance as "pretty shambolic", while Plant characterised it as an "atrocity".\u000a\u000aThe three members reunited again on 14 May 1988, for the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert, with Bonham's son, Jason Bonham, on drums. The result was another disjointed performance, after Plant and Page had argued immediately prior to coming on stage about whether to play "Stairway to Heaven", and with the complete loss of Jones' keyboards on the live television feed. Page described the performance as "one big disappointment", and Plant said that "the gig was foul".\u000a\u000aThe first Led Zeppelin box set, featuring tracks remastered under Page's supervision, was released in 1990 and bolstered the band's reputation, leading to abortive discussions among members about a reunion. This set included four previously unreleased tracks, including a version of Robert Johnson's "Travelling Riverside Blues". The song peaked at number seven on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart. 1992 saw the release of the "Immigrant Song"/"Hey Hey What Can I Do" (the original B-side) as a CD single in the US. Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2 was released in 1993; the two box sets together containing all known studio recordings, as well as some rare live tracks.\u000a\u000aIn 1994, Page and Plant reunited for a 90-minute "UnLedded" MTV project. They later released an album called No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded, which featured some reworked Led Zeppelin songs, and embarked on a world tour the following year. This is said to be the beginning of a rift between the band members, as Jones was not even told of the reunion.\u000a\u000aIn 1995, Led Zeppelin were inducted into the United States Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith. Jason and Zoë Bonham also attended, representing their late father. At the induction ceremony, the band's inner rift became apparent when Jones joked upon accepting his award, "Thank you, my friends, for finally remembering my phone number", causing consternation and awkward looks from Page and Plant. Afterwards, they played one brief set with Tyler and Perry, with Jason Bonham on drums, and then a second with Neil Young, this time with Michael Lee playing the drums.\u000a\u000aIn 1997, Atlantic released a single edit of "Whole Lotta Love" in the US and the UK, the only single the band released in their homeland, where it peaked at number 21. November 1997 saw the release of Led Zeppelin BBC Sessions, a two-disc set largely recorded in 1969 and 1971. Page and Plant released another album called Walking into Clarksdale in 1998, featuring all new material, but after disappointing sales the partnership dissolved before a planned Australian tour.\u000a\u000a2003 saw the release of the triple live album How the West Was Won, and Led Zeppelin DVD, a six-hour chronological set of live footage that became the best-selling music DVD in history. In July 2007 Atlantic/Rhino and Warner Home Video announced three new Led Zeppelin titles to be released that November. First was Mothership, a 24-track best-of spanning the band's career, followed by a reissue of the soundtrack The Song Remains the Same, which included previously unreleased material, and a new DVD. Led Zeppelin also made their catalogue legally available for digital download, becoming one of the last major rock bands to do so.\u000a\u000aOn 10 December 2007 Led Zeppelin reunited for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at the O2 Arena in London, with Jason Bonham again taking his late father's place on drums. According to Guinness World Records 2009, Led Zeppelin set the world record for the "Highest Demand for Tickets for One Music Concert" as 20 million requests for the reunion show were rendered online. Music critics praised the band's performance and there was widespread speculation about a full reunion. Page, Jones and Jason Bonham were reported to be willing to tour, and to be working on material for a new Led Zeppelin project. Plant continued his touring commitments with Alison Krauss, stating in September 2008 that he would not be recording or touring with the band. Jones, Page and Bonham reportedly looked for a replacement for Plant, considering singers including Steven Tyler, and Myles Kennedy of Alter Bridge, but in January 2009 it was confirmed that the project had been abandoned. A film of the O2 performance, Celebration Day, premiered on 17 October 2012 and was released on home video on 19 November. The film grossed $2 million in one night, and the live album peaked at number 4 and 9 in the UK and US, respectively. Following the film's premiere, Page revealed that he had been remastering the band's discography with the first three albums re-released on 2 June 2014, containing bonus tracks.[121]\u000a\u000aLed Zeppelin's music was rooted in the blues. The influence of American blues artists such as Muddy Waters and Skip James was particularly apparent on their first two albums, as was the distinct country blues style of Howlin' Wolf. Tracks were structured around the twelve-bar blues on every studio album except for one, and the blues directly and indirectly influenced other songs both musically and lyrically. The band were also strongly influenced by the music of the British, Celtic and American folk revivals. Scottish folk guitarist Bert Jansch helped inspire Page, and from him he adapted open tunings and aggressive strokes into his playing. The band also drew on a wide variety of genres, including world music, and elements of early rock and roll, jazz, country, funk, soul and reggae, particularly on Houses of the Holy and the albums that followed.\u000a\u000aThe material on the first two albums was largely constructed out of extended jams of blues standards and folk songs. This method led to the mixing of musical and lyrical elements of different songs and versions, as well as improvised passages, to create new material, but would lead to later accusations of plagiarism and some legal disputes over copyright. Usually the music was developed first, sometimes with improvised lyrics that might then be rewritten for the final version of the song. From the visit to Bron-Yr-Aur in 1970, the songwriting partnership between Page and Plant became predominant, with Page supplying the music, largely via his acoustic guitar, and Plant emerging as the band's chief lyricist. Jones and Bonham then added to the material, in rehearsal or in the studio, as a song was developed. In the later stages of the band's career, Page took a back seat in composition and Jones became increasingly important in producing music, often composed on the keyboard. Plant would then add lyrics before Page and Bonham developed their parts.\u000a\u000aEarly lyrics drew on the band's blues and folk roots, often mixing lyrical fragments from different songs. Many of the band's songs dealt with themes of romance, unrequited love and sexual conquest, which were common in rock, pop and blues music. Some of their lyrics, especially those derived from the blues, have been interpreted as misogynistic. Particularly on Led Zeppelin III, they incorporated elements of mythology and mysticism into their music, which largely grew out of Plant's interest in legends and history. These elements were often taken to reflect Page's interest in the occult, which resulted in accusations that the recordings contained subliminal satanic messages, some of which were said to be contained in backmasking; these claims were generally dismissed by the band and music critics. Susan Fast argues that as Plant emerged as the band's main lyricist, the songs more obviously reflected his alignment with the West Coast counterculture of the 1960s. In the later part of the band's career Plant's lyrics became more autobiographical, and less optimistic, drawing on his own experiences and circumstances.\u000a\u000aAccording to musicologist Robert Walser, "Led Zeppelin's sound was marked by speed and power, unusual rhythmic patterns, contrasting terraced dynamics, singer Robert Plant's wailing vocals, and guitarist Jimmy Page's heavily distorted crunch". These elements mean that they are often cited as one of the progenitors of hard rock and heavy metal and they have been described as the "definitive heavy metal band", although the band members have often eschewed the label. Part of this reputation depends on the band's use of distorted guitar riffs on songs like "Whole Lotta Love" and "The Wanton Song". Often riffs were not doubled by guitar, bass and drums exactly, but instead there were melodic or rhythmic variations; as in "Black Dog", where three different time signatures are used. Page's guitar playing incorporated elements of the blues scale with those of eastern music. Plant's use of high-pitched shrieks has been compared to Janis Joplin's vocal technique. Bonham's drumming was noted for its power, his rapid rolls and his fast beats on a single bass drum. Jones' basslines have been described as melodic and his keyboard playing added a classical touch to the band's sound.\u000a\u000aPage stated that he wanted Led Zeppelin to produce music that had "light and shade". This began to be more clearly realised beginning with Led Zeppelin III, which made greater use of acoustic instruments. This approach has been seen as exemplified in the fourth album, particularly on "Stairway to Heaven", which begins with acoustic guitar and recorder and ends with drums and heavy electric sounds. Towards the end of their recording career, they moved to a more mellow and progressive sound, dominated by Jones' keyboard motifs. They also increasingly made use of various layering and production techniques, including multi-tracking and overdubbed guitar parts. Their emphasis on the sense of dynamics and ensemble arrangement has been seen as producing an individualistic style that transcends any single music genre. Ian Peddie argues that they were "... loud, powerful and often heavy, but their music was also humorous, self-reflective and extremely subtle".\u000a\u000aLed Zeppelin are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock bands in the history of music. Rock critic Mikal Gilmore said, "Led Zeppelin\u2014talented, complex, grasping, beautiful and dangerous\u2014made one of the most enduring bodies of composition and performance in twentieth-century music, despite everything they had to overpower, including themselves".\u000a\u000aLed Zeppelin have influenced hard rock and heavy metal bands such as Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Rush, Queen, and Megadeth as well as progressive metal bands like Tool and Dream Theater. They influenced some early punk and post-punk bands, among them the Ramones and the Cult. They were also an important influence on the development of alternative rock, as bands adapted elements from the "Zeppelin sound" of the mid-1970s, including the Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. Bands and artists from diverse genres have acknowledged the influence of Led Zeppelin, such as Madonna, Shakira, Lady Gaga, and Katie Melua.\u000a\u000aLed Zeppelin have been credited with a major impact on the nature of the music business, particularly in the development of album-orientated rock (AOR) and stadium rock. In 1988 John Kalodner, then-A&R executive of Geffen Records, remarked that "In my opinion, next to the Beatles they're the most influential band in history. They influence the way music is on records, AOR radio, concerts. They set the standards for the AOR-radio format with 'Stairway to Heaven,' having AOR hits without necessarily having Top 40 hits. They're the ones who did the first real big arena concert shows, consistently selling out and playing stadiums without support. People can do as well as them, but nobody surpasses them". Andrew Loog Oldham, the former producer and manager of the Rolling Stones, commented on how Led Zeppelin had a major influence on the record business, and the way rock concerts were managed and presented to huge audiences.\u000a\u000aThe band have sold over 200 million albums worldwide according to some sources, while other sources state that they have sold in excess of 300 million records, including 111.5 million certified units in the United States. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Led Zeppelin are the second-highest-selling band, the fourth highest selling music act in the US and one of only three acts to earn four or more Diamond albums. Led Zeppelin remain one of the most bootlegged artists in the history of rock music.\u000a\u000aLed Zeppelin also had a significant cultural impact. Jim Miller, editor of Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll, argues that "On one level, Led Zeppelin represents the final flowering of the sixties' psychedelic ethic, which casts rock as passive sensory involvement". Led Zeppelin have also been described as "the quintessential purveyors" of masculine and aggressive "cock rock", although this assertion has been challenged. The band's fashion-sense has been seminal; Simeon Lipman, head of pop culture at Christie's auction house, has commented that "Led Zeppelin have had a big influence on fashion because the whole aura surrounding them is so cool, and people want a piece of that". Led Zeppelin laid the foundation for the big hair of 1980s glam metal bands such as Mötley Crüe and Skid Row. Other musicians have also adapted elements from Led Zeppelin's attitude to clothes, jewellery and hair, such as the hipster flares and tight band t-shirts of Kings of Leon, shaggy hair, clingy t-shirts and bluesman hair of Jack White of the White Stripes, and Kasabian guitarist Sergio Pizzorno's silk scarves, trilbies and side-laced tight jeans.\u000a\u000aThroughout their career, Led Zeppelin have collected many honours and awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006. Among the band's awards are an American Music Award in 2005, and the Polar Music Prize in 2006. Led Zeppelin were the recipient of a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005, and four of their recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. They have been awarded five Diamond albums, as well as fourteen Multi-Platinum, four Platinum and one Gold album in the United States, while in the UK they have five Multi-Platinum, six Platinum, one Gold and four Silver albums. In addition to listing five of their albums among "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time", Rolling Stone named Led Zeppelin the 14th-greatest artist of all time in 2004.\u000a\u000aPage was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his charity work in 2005 and Plant was honoured as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to popular music in 2009. The band are ranked number one on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock and Classic Rock's "50 best live acts of all time". They were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for "Outstanding Contribution to British Music" in 1977, as well as a "Lifetime Achievement Award" at the 42nd Annual Ivor Novello awards ceremony in 1997. The band were honoured at the 2008 MOJO Awards with the "Best Live Act" prize for their one-off reunion, and were described as the "greatest rock and roll band of all time". The three surviving members (Page, Plant, and Jones) were named as 2012 recipients of Kennedy Center Honors.

VThe domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris,[2][3] previously Canis familiaris) is a member of the Canidae family of the mammalian order Carnivora. The term "domestic dog" is generally used for both domesticated and feral varieties. The dog was the first domesticated animal[4][5] and has been the most widely kept working, hunting, and pet animal in human history.[citation needed] The word "dog" can also refer to the male of a canine species,[6] as opposed to the word "bitch" which refers to the female of the species.\u000a\u000aRecent studies of "well-preserved remains of a dog-like canid from the Razboinichya Cave" in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia concluded that a particular instance of early wolf domestication approximately 33,000 years ago did not result in modern dog lineages, possibly because of climate disruption during the Last Glacial Maximum.[4][7] The authors postulate that at least several such incipient events have occurred. A study of fossil dogs and wolves in Belgium, Ukraine, and Russia tentatively dates domestication from 14,000 years ago to more than 31,700 years ago.[8] Another recent study has found support for claims of dog domestication between 14,000 and 16,000 years ago, with a range between 9,000 and 34,000 years ago, depending on mutation rate assumptions.[9] Dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals. This impact on human society has given them the nickname "man's best friend" in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs are also a source of meat.[10][11] In 2001, there were estimated to be 400 million dogs in the world.[12]\u000a\u000aMost breeds of dog are at most a few hundred years old, having been artificially selected for particular morphologies and behaviors by people for specific functional roles. Through this selective breeding, the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal.[13] For example, height measured to the withers ranges from 15.2 centimetres (6.0 in) in the Chihuahua to about 76 cm (30 in) in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called "blue") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark ("red" or "chocolate") in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth.[14] It is common for most breeds to shed this coat.\u000a\u000aDog is the common use term that refers to members of the subspecies Canis lupus familiaris (canis, "dog"; lupus, "wolf"; familiaris, "of a household" or "domestic"). The term can also be used to refer to a wider range of related species, such as the members of the genus Canis, or "true dogs", including the wolf, coyote, and jackals, or it can refer to the members of the tribe Canini, which would also include the African wild dog, or it can be used to refer to any member of the family Canidae, which would also include the foxes, bush dog, raccoon dog, and others.[15] Some members of the family have dog in their common names, such as the raccoon dog and the African wild dog. A few animals have dog in their common names but are not canids, such as the prairie dog.\u000a\u000aThe English word dog comes from Middle English dogge, from Old English docga, a "powerful dog breed".[16] The term may possibly derive from Proto-Germanic *dukk\u014dn, represented in Old English finger-docce ("finger-muscle").[17] The word also shows the familiar petname diminutive -ga also seen in frogga "frog", picga "pig", stagga "stag", wicga "beetle, worm", among others.[18] The term dog may ultimately derive from the earliest layer of Proto-Indo-European vocabulary, reflecting the role of the dog as the earliest domesticated animal.[19]\u000a\u000aIn 14th-century England, hound (from Old English: hund) was the general word for all domestic canines, and dog referred to a subtype of hound, a group including the mastiff. It is believed this "dog" type was so common, it eventually became the prototype of the category "hound".[20] By the 16th century, dog had become the general word, and hound had begun to refer only to types used for hunting.[21] Hound, cognate to German Hund, Dutch hond, common Scandinavian hund, and Icelandic hundur, is ultimately derived from the Proto-Indo-European *kwon- "dog", found in Sanskrit kukuur (\u0915\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0915\u0941\u0930),[22] Welsh ci (plural cwn), Latin canis, Greek ký\u014dn, and Lithuanian \u0161uõ.[23]\u000a\u000aIn breeding circles, a male canine is referred to as a dog, while a female is called a bitch (Middle English bicche, from Old English bicce, ultimately from Old Norse bikkja). A group of offspring is a litter. The father of a litter is called the sire, and the mother is called the dam. Offspring are, in general, called pups or puppies, from French poupée, until they are about a year old. The process of birth is whelping, from the Old English word hwelp (cf. German Welpe, Dutch welp, Swedish valpa, Icelandic hvelpur).[24] The term "whelp" can also be used to refer to the young of any canid, or as a (somewhat archaic) alternative to "puppy".\u000a\u000aIn 1753, the father of modern biological taxonomy, Carl Linnaeus, listed among the types of quadrupeds familiar to him, the Latin word for dog, canis. Among the species within this genus, Linnaeus listed the fox, as Canis vulpes, wolves (Canis lupus), and the domestic dog, (Canis canis). In later editions, Linnaeus dropped Canis canis and greatly expanded his list of the Canis genus of quadrupeds, and by 1758 included alongside the foxes, wolves, and jackals and many more terms that are now listed as synonyms for domestic dog, including aegyptius (hairless dog), aquaticus, (water dog), and mustelinus (literally "badger dog"). Among these were two that later experts have been widely used for domestic dogs as a species: Canis domesticus and, most predominantly, Canis familiaris, the "common" or "familiar" dog.[25]\u000a\u000aThe domestic dog was accepted as a species in its own right until overwhelming evidence from behavior, vocalizations, morphology, and molecular biology led to the contemporary scientific understanding that a single species, the gray wolf, is the common ancestor for all breeds of domestic dogs.[26][27][28] In recognition of this fact, the domestic dog was reclassified in 1993 as Canis lupus familiaris, a subspecies of the gray wolf Canis lupus, by the Smithsonian Institution and the American Society of Mammalogists. C. l. familiaris is listed as the name for the taxon that is broadly used in the scientific community and recommended by ITIS, although Canis familiaris is a recognised synonym.[29]\u000a\u000aSince that time, C. domesticus and all taxa referring to domestic dogs or subspecies of dog listed by Linnaeus, Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1792, and Christian Smith in 1839, lost their subspecies status and have been listed as taxonomic synonyms for Canis lupus familiaris.[30]\u000a\u000aDomestic dogs inherited complex behaviors from their wolf ancestors, which would have been pack hunters with complex body language. These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations, and these attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful species on the planet today.[26]\u000a\u000aAlthough experts largely disagree over the details of dog domestication, it is agreed that human interaction played a significant role in shaping the subspecies.[31] Domestication may have occurred initially in separate areas, particularly Siberia and Europe. It is thought that the current lineage of dogs were domesticated between 15,000 years and 8,500 years ago. Shortly after the latest domestication, dogs became ubiquitous in human populations, and spread throughout the world.\u000a\u000aEmigrants from Siberia likely crossed the Bering Strait with dogs in their company, and some experts[32] suggest the use of sled dogs may have been critical to the success of the waves that entered North America roughly 12,000 years ago,[32] although the earliest archaeological evidence of dog-like canids in North America dates from about 9,400 years ago.[33][34] Dogs were an important part of life for the Athabascan population in North America, and were their only domesticated animal. Dogs also carried much of the load in the migration of the Apache and Navajo tribes 1,400 years ago. Use of dogs as pack animals in these cultures often persisted after the introduction of the horse to North America.[35]\u000a\u000aThe current consensus among biologists and archaeologists is that the dating of first domestication is indeterminate,[31][35] although more recent evidence shows isolated domestication events as early as 33,000 years ago.[36][37] There is conclusive evidence the present lineage of dogs genetically diverged from their wolf ancestors at least 15,000 years ago,[38][39][40][41][42] but some believe domestication to have occurred earlier.[31] Evidence is accruing that there were previous domestication events, but that those lineages died out.[43]\u000a\u000aIt is not known whether humans domesticated the wolf as such to initiate dog's divergence from its ancestors, or whether dog's evolutionary path had already taken a different course prior to domestication. For example, it is hypothesized that some wolves gathered around the campsites of paleolithic camps to scavenge refuse, and associated evolutionary pressure developed that favored those who were less frightened by, and keener in approaching, humans.[44]\u000a\u000aThe bulk of the scientific evidence for the evolution of the domestic dog stems from morphological studies of archaeological findings and mitochondrial DNA studies. The divergence date of roughly 15,000 years ago is based in part on archaeological evidence that demonstrates the domestication of dogs occurred more than 15,000 years ago,[26][35] and some genetic evidence indicates the domestication of dogs from their wolf ancestors began in the late Upper Paleolithic close to the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary, between 17,000 and 14,000 years ago.[45] But there is a wide range of other, contradictory findings that make this issue controversial.[citation needed] There are findings beginning currently at 33,000 years ago distinctly placing them as domesticated dogs evidenced not only by shortening of the muzzle but widening as well as crowding of teeth.\u000a\u000aArchaeological evidence suggests that the latest point at which dogs could have diverged from wolves was roughly 15,000 years ago, although it is possible they diverged much earlier.[26] In 2008, a team of international scientists released findings from an excavation at Goyet Cave in Belgium declaring a large, toothy canine existed 31,700 years ago and ate a diet of horse, musk ox and reindeer.[46]\u000a\u000aPrior to this Belgian discovery, the earliest dog bones found were two large skulls from Russia and a mandible from Germany dated from roughly 14,000 years ago.[26][40] Remains of smaller dogs from Natufian cave deposits in the Middle East, including the earliest burial of a human being with a domestic dog, have been dated to around 10,000 to 12,000 years ago.[40][47] There is a great deal of archaeological evidence for dogs throughout Europe and Asia around this period and through the next two thousand years (roughly 8,000 to 10,000 years ago), with specimens uncovered in Germany, the French Alps, and Iraq, and cave paintings in Turkey.[26] The oldest remains of a domesticated dog in the Americas were found in Texas and have been dated to about 9,400 years ago.[48]\u000a\u000aDNA studies have provided a wide range of possible divergence dates, from 15,000 to 40,000 years ago,[40] to as much as 100,000 to 140,000 years ago.[49] These results depend on a number of assumptions.[26] Genetic studies are based on comparisons of genetic diversity between species, and depend on a calibration date. Some estimates of divergence dates from DNA evidence use an estimated wolf\u2013coyote divergence date of roughly 700,000 years ago as a calibration.[50] If this estimate is incorrect, and the actual wolf\u2013coyote divergence is closer to one or two million years ago, or more,[51] than the DNA evidence that supports specific dog\u2013wolf divergence dates would be interpreted very differently.\u000a\u000aFurthermore, it is believed the genetic diversity of wolves has been in decline for the last 200 years, and that the genetic diversity of dogs has been reduced by selective breeding. This could significantly bias DNA analyses to support an earlier divergence date. The genetic evidence for the domestication event occurring in East Asia is also subject to violations of assumptions. These conclusions are based on the location of maximal genetic divergence, and assume hybridization does not occur, and that breeds remain geographically localized. Although these assumptions hold for many species, there is good reason to believe that they do not hold for canines.[26]\u000a\u000aGenetic analyses indicate all dogs are likely descended from a handful of domestication events with a small number of founding females,[26][45] although there is evidence domesticated dogs interbred with local populations of wild wolves on several occasions.[40] Data suggest dogs first diverged from wolves in East Asia, and these domesticated dogs then quickly migrated throughout the world, reaching the North American continent around 8000 BC.[40] The oldest groups of dogs, which show the greatest genetic variability and are the most similar to their wolf ancestors, are primarily Asian and African breeds, including the Basenji, Lhasa Apso, and Siberian Husky.[52] Some breeds thought to be very old, such as the Pharaoh Hound, Ibizan Hound, and Norwegian Elkhound, are now known to have been created more recently.[52]\u000a\u000aA great deal of controversy surrounds the evolutionary framework for the domestication of dogs.[26] Although it is widely claimed that "man domesticated the wolf,"[53] man might not have taken such a proactive role in the process.[26] The nature of the interaction between man and wolf that led to domestication is unknown and controversial. At least three early species of the Homo genus began spreading out of Africa roughly 400,000 years ago, and thus lived for a considerable time in contact with canine species.[26]\u000a\u000aDespite this, there is no evidence of any adaptation of canine species to the presence of the close relatives of modern man. If dogs were domesticated, as believed, roughly 15,000 years ago, the event (or events) would have coincided with a large expansion in human territory and the development of agriculture. This has led some biologists to suggest one of the forces that led to the domestication of dogs was a shift in human lifestyle in the form of established human settlements. Permanent settlements would have coincided with a greater amount of disposable food and would have created a barrier between wild and anthropogenic canine populations.[26]\u000a\u000aIn 2013 Thalmann, Krause and coworkers revised the view that dog ancestors came from East Asia and showed using DNA analysis that "all dogs living today go back to four genetic lineages, all of which originate in Europe." [54] Their data indicated that bonding between humans and dog occurred between 19,000 and 30,000 years ago, likely in the context of hunting.[54] The Zarzian culture, an archaeological culture of late Paleolithic and Mesolithic (18,000-8,000 years BC) in Iraq, Iran, Central Asia is associated with remains of the domesticated dog.[55]\u000a\u000aWolves, and their dog descendants, would have derived significant benefits from living in human camps\u2014more safety, more reliable food, lesser caloric needs, and more chance to breed.[56] They would have benefited from humans' upright gait that gives them larger range over which to see potential predators and prey, as well as color vision that, at least by day, gives humans better visual discrimination.[56] Camp dogs would also have benefitted from human tool use, as in bringing down larger prey and controlling fire for a range of purposes.[56]\u000a\u000aHumans would also have derived enormous benefit from the dogs associated with their camps.[57] For instance, dogs would have improved sanitation by cleaning up food scraps.[57] Dogs may have provided warmth, as referred to in the Australian Aboriginal expression "three dog night" (an exceptionally cold night), and they would have alerted the camp to the presence of predators or strangers, using their acute hearing to provide an early warning.[57]\u000a\u000aAnthropologists believe the most significant benefit would have been the use of dogs' sensitive sense of smell to assist with the hunt.[57] The relationship between the presence of a dog and success in the hunt is often mentioned as a primary reason for the domestication of the wolf, and a 2004 study of hunter groups with and without a dog gives quantitative support to the hypothesis that the benefits of cooperative hunting was an important factor in wolf domestication.[58]\u000a\u000aThe cohabitation of dogs and humans would have greatly improved the chances of survival for early human groups, and the domestication of dogs may have been one of the key forces that led to human success.[59]\u000a\u000a"The most widespread form of interspecies bonding occurs between humans and dogs"[57] and the keeping of dogs as companions, particularly by elites, has a long history.[60] (As a possible example, at the Natufian culture site of Ain Mallaha in Israel, dated to 12,000 BC, the remains of an elderly human and a four-to-five-month-old puppy were found buried together).[61] However, pet dog populations grew significantly after World War II as suburbanization increased.[60] In the 1950s and 1960s, dogs were kept outside more often than they tend to be today[62] (using the expression "in the doghouse" to describe exclusion from the group signifies the distance between the doghouse and the home) and were still primarily functional, acting as a guard, children's playmate, or walking companion. From the 1980s, there have been changes in the role of the pet dog, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians.[63] People and dogs have become increasingly integrated and implicated in each other's lives,[64] to the point where pet dogs actively shape the way a family and home are experienced.[65]\u000a\u000aThere have been two major trends in the changing status of pet dogs. The first has been the 'commodification' of the dog, shaping it to conform to human expectations of personality and behaviour.[65] The second has been the broadening of the concept of the family and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices.[65]\u000a\u000aThere are a vast range of commodity forms available to transform a pet dog into an ideal companion.[66] The list of goods, services and places available is enormous: from dog perfumes, couture, furniture and housing, to dog groomers, therapists, trainers and caretakers, dog cafes, spas, parks and beaches, and dog hotels, airlines and cemeteries.[66] While dog training as an organized activity can be traced back to the 18th century, in the last decades of the 20th century it became a high profile issue as many normal dog behaviors such as barking, jumping up, digging, rolling in dung, fighting, and urine marking[further explanation needed] became increasingly incompatible with the new role of a pet dog.[67] Dog training books, classes and television programs proliferated as the process of commodifying the pet dog continued.[68]\u000a\u000aThe majority of contemporary people with dogs describe their pet as part of the family,[65] although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog\u2013human family as a pack.[65] A dominance model of dog\u2013human relationships has been promoted by some dog trainers, such as on the television program Dog Whisperer. However it has been disputed that "trying to achieve status" is characteristic of dog\u2013human interactions.[69] Pet dogs play an active role in family life; for example, a study of conversations in dog\u2013human families showed how family members use the dog as a resource, talking to the dog, or talking through the dog, to mediate their interactions with each other.[70]\u000a\u000aAnother study of dogs' roles in families showed many dogs have set tasks or routines undertaken as family members, the most common of which was helping with the washing-up by licking the plates in the dishwasher, and bringing in the newspaper from the lawn.[65] Increasingly, human family members are engaging in activities centered on the perceived needs and interests of the dog, or in which the dog is an integral partner, such as Dog Dancing and Doga.[66]\u000a\u000aAccording to statistics published by the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association in the National Pet Owner Survey in 2009\u20132010, it is estimated there are 77.5 million people with pet dogs in the United States.[71] The same survey shows nearly 40% of American households own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% two dogs and nearly 9% more than two dogs. There does not seem to be any gender preference among dogs as pets, as the statistical data reveal an equal number of female and male dog pets. Yet, although several programs are undergoing to promote pet adoption, less than a fifth of the owned dogs come from a shelter.\u000a\u000aThe latest study using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to humans and dogs together proved that dogs have same response of voices and use the same parts of brain as humans and made dogs understand of emotional human voices, made the dogs as friendly social pets to humans.[72]\u000a\u000aDogs have lived and worked with humans in so many roles that they have earned the unique nickname, "man's best friend",[73] a phrase used in other languages as well. They have been bred for herding livestock,[74] hunting (e.g. pointers and hounds),[75] rodent control,[3] guarding, helping fishermen with nets, detection dogs, and pulling loads, in addition to their roles as companions.[3] In 1957, a husky-terrier mix named Laika became the first animal to orbit the Earth.[76][77]\u000a\u000aService dogs such as guide dogs, utility dogs, assistance dogs, hearing dogs, and psychological therapy dogs provide assistance to individuals with physical or mental disabilities.[78][79] Some dogs owned by epileptics have been shown to alert their handler when the handler shows signs of an impending seizure, sometimes well in advance of onset, allowing the guardian to seek safety, medication, or medical care.[80]\u000a\u000aDogs included in human activities in terms of helping out humans are usually called working dogs. Dogs of several breeds are considered working dogs. Some working dog breeds include Akita, Alaskan Malamute, Anatolian Shepherd Dog, Bernese Mountain Dog, Black Russian Terrier, Boxer, Bullmastiff, Doberman Pinscher, Dogue de Bordeaux, German Pinscher, German Shepherd,[81] Giant Schnauzer, Great Dane, Great Pyrenees, Great Swiss Mountain Dog, Komondor, Kuvasz, Mastiff, Neapolitan Mastiff, Newfoundland, Portuguese Water Dog, Rottweiler, Saint Bernard, Samoyed, Siberian Husky, Standard Schnauzer, and Tibetan Mastiff.\u000a\u000aPeople often enter their dogs in competitions[82] such as breed-conformation shows or sports, including racing, sledding and agility competitions.\u000a\u000aIn conformation shows, also referred to as breed shows, a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed type as described in the breed standard. As the breed standard only deals with the externally observable qualities of the dog (such as appearance, movement, and temperament), separately tested qualities (such as ability or health) are not part of the judging in conformation shows.\u000a\u000aDog meat is consumed in some East Asian countries, including Korea, China, and Vietnam, a practice that dates back to antiquity.[83] It is estimated that 13\u201316 million dogs are killed and consumed in Asia every year.[84] The BBC claims that, in 1999, more than 6,000 restaurants served soups made from dog meat in South Korea.[85] In Korea, the primary dog breed raised for meat, the nureongi (\ub204\ub801\uc774), differs from those breeds raised for pets that Koreans may keep in their homes.[86]\u000a\u000aThe most popular Korean dog dish is gaejang-guk (also called bosintang), a spicy stew meant to balance the body's heat during the summer months; followers of the custom claim this is done to ensure good health by balancing one's gi, or vital energy of the body. A 19th century version of gaejang-guk explains that the dish is prepared by boiling dog meat with scallions and chili powder. Variations of the dish contain chicken and bamboo shoots. While the dishes are still popular in Korea with a segment of the population, dog is not as widely consumed as beef, chicken, and pork.[87]\u000a\u000aA CNN report in China dated March 2010 includes an interview with a dog meat vendor who stated that most of the dogs that are available for selling to restaurants are raised in special farms but that there is always a chance that a sold dog is someone's lost pet, although dog pet breeds are not considered edible.[88]\u000a\u000aOther cultures, such as Polynesia and pre-Columbian Mexico, also consumed dog meat in their history. However, Western, South Asian, African, and Middle Eastern cultures, in general, regard consumption of dog meat as taboo. In some places, however, such as in rural areas of Poland, dog fat is believed to have medicinal properties\u2014being good for the lungs for instance.[89] Dog meat is also consumed in some parts of Switzerland.[90]\u000a\u000aIt is estimated that 4.7 million people are bitten by dogs each year.[91] In the 1980s and 1990s the US averaged 17 fatalities per year, while in the 2000s this has increased to 26.[92] 77% of dog bites are from the pet of family or friends, and 50% of attacks occur on the property of the dog's legal owner.[92]\u000a\u000aA Colorado study found bites in children were less severe than bites in adults.[93] The incidence of dog bites in the US is 12.9 per 10,000 inhabitants, but for boys aged 5 to 9, the incidence rate is 60.7 per 10,000. Moreover, children have a much higher chance to be bitten in the face or neck.[94] Sharp claws with powerful muscles behind them can lacerate flesh in a scratch that can lead to serious infections.[95]\u000a\u000aIn the UK between 2003 and 2004, there were 5,868 dog attacks on humans, resulting in 5,770 working days lost in sick leave.[96]\u000a\u000aIn the United States, cats and dogs are a factor in more than 86,000 falls each year.[97] It has been estimated around 2% of dog-related injuries treated in UK hospitals are domestic accidents. The same study found that while dog involvement in road traffic accidents was difficult to quantify, dog-associated road accidents involving injury more commonly involved two-wheeled vehicles.[98]\u000a\u000aToxocara canis (dog roundworm) eggs in dog feces can cause toxocariasis. In the United States, about 10,000 cases of Toxocara infection are reported in humans each year, and almost 14% of the U.S. population is infected.[99] In Great Britain, 24% of soil samples taken from public parks contained T. canis eggs.[100] Untreated toxocariasis can cause retinal damage and decreased vision.[100] Dog feces can also contain hookworms that cause cutaneous larva migrans in humans.[101][102][103][104]\u000a\u000aThe scientific evidence is mixed as to whether companionship of a dog can enhance human physical health and psychological wellbeing.[105] Studies suggesting that there are benefits to physical health and psychological wellbeing[106] have been criticised for being poorly controlled,[107] and finding that "[t]he health of elderly people is related to their health habits and social supports but not to their ownership of, or attachment to, a companion animal." Earlier studies have shown that people who keep pet dogs or cats exhibit better mental and physical health than those who do not, making fewer visits to the doctor and being less likely to be on medication than non-guardians.[108]\u000a\u000aA 2005 paper states "recent research has failed to support earlier findings that pet ownership is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, a reduced use of general practitioner services, or any psychological or physical benefits on health for community dwelling older people. Research has, however, pointed to significantly less absenteeism from school through sickness among children who live with pets."[105] In one study, new guardians reported a highly significant reduction in minor health problems during the first month following pet acquisition, and this effect was sustained in those with dogs through to the end of the study.[109]\u000a\u000aIn addition, people with pet dogs took considerably more physical exercise than those with cats and those without pets. The group without pets exhibited no statistically significant changes in health or behaviour. The results provide evidence that keeping pets may have positive effects on human health and behaviour, and that for guardians of dogs these effects are relatively long-term.[109] Pet guardianship has also been associated with increased coronary artery disease survival, with human guardians being significantly less likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who did not own dogs.[110]\u000a\u000aThe health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, and not solely from having dogs as pets. For example, when in the presence of a pet dog, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral, and psychological indicators of anxiety.[111] Other health benefits are gained from exposure to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which, according to the hygiene hypothesis, can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases. The benefits of contact with a dog also include social support, as dogs are able to not only provide companionship and social support themselves, but also to act as facilitators of social interactions between humans.[112] One study indicated that wheelchair users experience more positive social interactions with strangers when they are accompanied by a dog than when they are not.[113]\u000a\u000aThe practice of using dogs and other animals as a part of therapy dates back to the late 18th century, when animals were introduced into mental institutions to help socialize patients with mental disorders.[114] Animal-assisted intervention research has shown that animal-assisted therapy with a dog can increase social behaviors, such as smiling and laughing, among people with Alzheimer's disease.[115] One study demonstrated that children with ADHD and conduct disorders who participated in an education program with dogs and other animals showed increased attendance, increased knowledge and skill objectives, and decreased antisocial and violent behavior compared to those who were not in an animal-assisted program.[116]\u000a\u000aEvery year, between 6 and 8 million dogs and cats enter US animal shelters.[117] The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) estimates that approximately 3 to 4 million of those dogs and cats are euthanized yearly in the United States.[118] However, the percentage of dogs in US animal shelters that are eventually adopted and removed from the shelters by their new legal owners has increased since the mid-1990s from around 25% to a 2012 average of 40% among reporting shelters[119] (and many shelters reporting 60\u201375%).[120]\u000a\u000aDomestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[3] Modern dog breeds show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal. Nevertheless, their morphology is based on that of their wild ancestors, gray wolves.[3] Dogs are predators and scavengers, and like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing.\u000a\u000aDogs are highly variable in height and weight. The smallest known adult dog was a Yorkshire Terrier, that stood only 6.3 cm (2.5 in) at the shoulder, 9.5 cm (3.7 in) in length along the head-and-body, and weighed only 113 grams (4.0 oz). The largest known dog was an English Mastiff which weighed 155.6 kg (343 lb) and was 250 cm (98 in) from the snout to the tail.[121] The tallest dog is a Great Dane that stands 106.7 cm (42.0 in) at the shoulder.[122]\u000a\u000aLike most mammals, dogs are dichromats and have color vision equivalent to red\u2013green color blindness in humans (deuteranopia).[123][124][125][126] So, dogs can see blue and yellow, but have difficulty differentiating red and green because they only have two spectral types of cone photoreceptor, while normal humans have three. And dogs use color instead of brightness to differentiate light or dark blue/yellow.[127][128][129][130] Dogs are less sensitive to differences in grey shades than humans and also can detect brightness at about half the accuracy of humans.[131]\u000a\u000aThe dog's visual system has evolved to aid proficient hunting.[123] While a dog's visual acuity is poor (that of a poodle's has been estimated to translate to a Snellen rating of 20/75[123]), their visual discrimination for moving objects is very high; dogs have been shown to be able to discriminate between humans (e.g., identifying their human guardian) at a range of between 800 and 900 m, however this range decreases to 500\u2013600 m if the object is stationary.[123]\u000a\u000aDogs have a temporal resolution of between 60 and 70 Hz, which explains why many dogs struggle to watch television, as most such modern screens are optimized for humans at 50\u201360 Hz.[131] Dogs can detect a change in movement that exists in a single diopter of space within their eye. Humans, by comparison, require a change of between 10 and 20 diopters to detect movement.[132][133]\u000a\u000aAs crepuscular hunters, dogs often rely on their vision in low light situations: They have very large pupils, a high density of rods in the fovea, an increased flicker rate, and a tapetum lucidum.[123] The tapetum is a reflective surface behind the retina that reflects light to give the photoreceptors a second chance to catch the photons. There is also a relationship between body size and overall diameter of the eye. A range of 9.5 and 11.6 mm can be found between various breeds of dogs. This 20% variance can be substantial and is associated as an adaptation toward superior night vision.[134]\u000a\u000aThe eyes of different breeds of dogs have different shapes, dimensions, and retina configurations.[135] Many long-nosed breeds have a "visual streak"\u2014a wide foveal region that runs across the width of the retina and gives them a very wide field of excellent vision. Some long-muzzled breeds, in particular, the sighthounds, have a field of vision up to 270° (compared to 180° for humans). Short-nosed breeds, on the other hand, have an "area centralis": a central patch with up to three times the density of nerve endings as the visual streak, giving them detailed sight much more like a human's. Some broad-headed breeds with short noses have a field of vision similar to that of humans.[124][125]\u000a\u000aMost breeds have good vision, but some show a genetic predisposition for myopia \u2013 such as Rottweilers, with which one out of every two has been found to be myopic.[123] Dogs also have a greater divergence of the eye axis than humans, enabling them to rotate their pupils farther in any direction. The divergence of the eye axis of dogs ranges from 12\u201325° depending on the breed.[132]\u000a\u000aExperimentation has proven that dogs can distinguish between complex visual images such as that of a cube or a prism. Dogs also show attraction to static visual images such as the silhouette of a dog on a screen, their own reflections, or videos of dogs; however, their interest declines sharply once they are unable to make social contact with the image.[136]\u000a\u000aThe frequency range of dog hearing is approximately 40 Hz to 60,000 Hz,[137] which means that dogs can detect sounds far beyond the upper limit of the human auditory spectrum.[125][137][138] In addition, dogs have ear mobility, which allows them to rapidly pinpoint the exact location of a sound.[139] Eighteen or more muscles can tilt, rotate, raise, or lower a dog's ear. A dog can identify a sound's location much faster than a human can, as well as hear sounds at four times the distance.[139]\u000a\u000aWhile the human brain is dominated by a large visual cortex, the dog brain is dominated by an olfactory cortex.[123] The olfactory bulb in dogs is roughly forty times bigger than the olfactory bulb in humans, relative to total brain size, with 125 to 220 million smell-sensitive receptors.[123] The bloodhound exceeds this standard with nearly 300 million receptors.[123]\u000a\u000aConsequently, it has been estimated that dogs, in general, have an olfactory sense ranging from one hundred thousand to one million times more sensitive than a human's. In some dog breeds, such as bloodhounds, the olfactory sense may be up to 100 million times greater than a human's.[140] The wet nose, or rhinarium, is essential for determining the direction of the air current containing the smell. Cold receptors in the skin are sensitive to the cooling of the skin by evaporation of the moisture by air currents.[141]\u000a\u000aThe coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "double" being common with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or "single", with the topcoat only.\u000a\u000aDomestic dogs often display the remnants of countershading, a common natural camouflage pattern. A countershaded animal will have dark coloring on its upper surfaces and light coloring below,[142] which reduces its general visibility. Thus, many breeds will have an occasional "blaze", stripe, or "star" of white fur on their chest or underside.[143]\u000a\u000aThere are many different shapes for dog tails: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or cork-screw. As with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be important in getting along with others. In some hunting dogs, however, the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries.[144] In some breeds, such as the Braque du Bourbonnais, puppies can be born with a short tail or no tail at all.[145]\u000a\u000aWhile all dogs are genetically very similar,[40] natural selection and selective breeding have reinforced certain characteristics in certain populations of dogs, giving rise to dog types and dog breeds. Dog types are broad categories based on function, genetics, or characteristics.[146] Dog breeds are groups of animals that possess a set of inherited characteristics that distinguishes them from other animals within the same species. Modern dog breeds are non-scientific classifications of dogs kept by modern kennel clubs.\u000a\u000aPurebred dogs of one breed are genetically distinguishable from purebred dogs of other breeds,[52] but the means by which kennel clubs classify dogs is unsystematic. Systematic analyses of the dog genome has revealed only four major types of dogs that can be said to be statistically distinct.[52] These include the "old world dogs" (e.g., Malamute and Shar Pei), "Mastiff"-type (e.g., English Mastiff), "herding"-type (e.g., Border Collie), and "all others" (also called "modern"- or "hunting"-type).[52][147]\u000a\u000aDogs are susceptible to various diseases, ailments, and poisons, some of which can affect humans. To defend against many common diseases, dogs are often vaccinated.\u000a\u000aThere are many household plants that are poisonous to dogs, begonia and aloe vera.[148] Poinsettia is often claimed to be toxic but this is untrue. The LD50 for rats was determined to be greater than 25g/kg.[149] This would mean that a 50 pound dog would have to eat 500-600 leaves to have a 50% chance of death.\u000a\u000aSome breeds of dogs are prone to certain genetic ailments such as elbow or hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, pulmonic stenosis, cleft palate, and trick knees. Two serious medical conditions particularly affecting dogs are pyometra, affecting unspayed females of all types and ages, and bloat, which affects the larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions, and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as fleas, ticks, and mites, as well as hookworm, tapeworm, roundworm, and heartworm.\u000a\u000aDogs are highly susceptible to theobromine poisoning, typically from ingestion of chocolate. Theobromine is toxic to dogs because, although the dog's metabolism is capable of breaking down the chemical, the process is so slow that even small amounts of chocolate can be fatal, especially dark chocolate.\u000a\u000aDogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans, including diabetes, dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis.[150]\u000a\u000aThe typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but for most the median longevity, the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive, ranges from 10 to 13 years.[151][152][153][154] Individual dogs may live well beyond the median of their breed.\u000a\u000aThe breed with the shortest lifespan (among breeds for which there is a questionnaire survey with a reasonable sample size) is the Dogue de Bordeaux, with a median longevity of about 5.2 years, but several breeds, including Miniature Bull Terriers, Bloodhounds, and Irish Wolfhounds are nearly as short-lived, with median longevities of 6 to 7 years.[154]\u000a\u000aThe longest-lived breeds, including Toy Poodles, Japanese Spitz, Border Terriers, and Tibetan Spaniels, have median longevities of 14 to 15 years.[154] The median longevity of mixed-breed dogs, taken as an average of all sizes, is one or more years longer than that of purebred dogs when all breeds are averaged.[152][153][154][155] The dog widely reported to be the longest-lived is "Bluey", who died in 1939 and was claimed to be 29.5 years old at the time of his death; however, the Bluey record is anecdotal and unverified.[156] On 5 December 2011, Pusuke, the world's oldest living dog recognized by Guinness Book of World Records, died aged 26 years and 9 months.[157]\u000a\u000aAlthough wild dogs, like wolves, are apex predators, they can be killed in territory disputes with wild animals.[158] Furthermore, in areas where both dogs and other large predators live, dogs can be a major food source for big cats or canines. Reports from Croatia indicate wolves kill dogs more frequently than they kill sheep. Wolves in Russia apparently limit feral dog populations. In Wisconsin, more compensation has been paid for dog losses than livestock.[158] Some wolf pairs have been reported to prey on dogs by having one wolf lure the dog out into heavy brush where the second animal waits in ambush.[159] In some instances, wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when attacking dogs, to the extent that they[which?] have to be beaten off or killed.[160]\u000a\u000aCoyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs. Leopards in particular are known to have a predilection for dogs, and have been recorded to kill and consume them regardless of the dog's size or ferocity.[161] Tigers in Manchuria, Indochina, Indonesia, and Malaysia are reputed to kill dogs with the same vigor as leopards.[162] Striped Hyenas are major predators of village dogs in Turkmenistan, India, and the Caucasus.[163] Reptiles such as alligators and pythons have been known to kill and eat dogs.\u000a\u000aDespite their descent from wolves and classification as Carnivora, dogs are variously described in scholarly and other writings as carnivores[164][165] or omnivores.[3][166][167][168] Unlike obligate carnivores, such as the cat family with its shorter small intestine, dogs can adapt to a wide-ranging diet, and are not dependent on meat-specific protein nor a very high level of protein in order to fulfill their basic dietary requirements. Dogs will healthily digest a variety of foods, including vegetables and grains, and can consume a large proportion of these in their diet.[3] Compared to their wolf ancestors, dogs have adaptations in genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet.[169]\u000a\u000aA number of common human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs, including chocolate solids (theobromine poisoning), onion and garlic (thiosulphate, sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning),[170] grapes and raisins, macadamia nuts, xylitol,[171] as well as various plants and other potentially ingested materials.[172][173] The nicotine in tobacco can also be dangerous. Dogs can get it by scavenging in garbage or ashtrays; eating cigars and cigarettes. Signs can be vomiting of large amounts (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea. Some other signs are abdominal pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or death. To solve, soothe the stomach irritation by giving charcoal tablets. For severe signs, get immediate veterinary attention.[174]\u000a\u000aIn domestic dogs, sexual maturity begins to happen around age six to twelve months for both males and females,[3][175] although this can be delayed until up to two years old for some large breeds. This is the time at which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle. They will experience subsequent estrous cycles biannually, during which the body prepares for pregnancy. At the peak of the cycle, females will come into estrus, being mentally and physically receptive to copulation.[3] Because the ova survive and are capable of being fertilized for a week after ovulation, it is possible for a female to mate with more than one male.[3]\u000a\u000aDogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after fertilization,[3][178] with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation can vary. An average litter consists of about six puppies,[179] though this number may vary widely based on the breed of dog. In general, toy dogs produce from one to four puppies in each litter, while much larger breeds may average as many as twelve.\u000a\u000aSome dog breeds have acquired traits through selective breeding that interfere with reproduction. Male French Bulldogs, for instance, are incapable of mounting the female. For many dogs of this breed, the female must be artificially inseminated in order to reproduce.[180]\u000a\u000aNeutering refers to the sterilization of animals, usually by removal of the male's testicles or the female's ovaries and uterus, in order to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce sex drive. Because of the overpopulation of dogs in some countries, many animal control agencies, such as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered, so that they do not have undesired puppies that may have to later be euthanized.[181]\u000a\u000aAccording to the Humane Society of the United States, 3\u20134 million dogs and cats are put down each year in the United States and many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes. Spaying or castrating dogs helps keep overpopulation down.[182] Local humane societies, SPCAs, and other animal protection organizations urge people to neuter their pets and to adopt animals from shelters instead of purchasing them.\u000a\u000aNeutering reduces problems caused by hypersexuality, especially in male dogs.[183] Spayed female dogs are less likely to develop some forms of cancer, affecting mammary glands, ovaries, and other reproductive organs.[184] However, neutering increases the risk of urinary incontinence in female dogs,[185] and prostate cancer in males,[186] as well as osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, cruciate ligament rupture, obesity, and diabetes mellitus in either sex.[187]\u000a\u000aBy the age of four weeks, the dog has developed the majority of its vocalizations.[188] The dog is the most vocal canid and is unique in its tendency to bark in a myriad of situations.[188]\u000a\u000aBarking appears to have little more communication functions than excitement, fighting, the presence of a human, or simply because other dogs are barking.[188] Subtler signs such as discreet bodily and facial movements, body odors, whines, yelps, and growls are the main sources of actual communication.[188] The majority of these subtle communication techniques are employed at a close proximity to another, but for long-range communication only barking and howling are employed.[188]\u000a\u000aThe domestic dog has a predisposition to exhibit a social intelligence that is uncommon in the animal world.[123] Dogs are capable of learning in a number of ways, such as through simple reinforcement (e.g., classical or operant conditioning) and by observation.[123]\u000a\u000aDogs go through a series of stages of cognitive development. As with humans, the understanding that objects not being actively perceived still remain in existence (called object permanence) is not present at birth. It develops as the young dog learns to interact intentionally with objects around it, at roughly 8 weeks of age.[123]\u000a\u000aPuppies learn behaviors quickly by following examples set by experienced dogs.[123] This form of intelligence is not peculiar to those tasks dogs have been bred to perform, but can be generalized to myriad abstract problems. For example, Dachshund puppies that watched an experienced dog pull a cart by tugging on an attached piece of ribbon in order to get a reward from inside the cart learned the task fifteen times faster than those left to solve the problem on their own.[123][190]\u000a\u000aDogs can also learn by mimicking human behaviors. In one study, puppies were presented with a box, and shown that, when a handler pressed a lever, a ball would roll out of the box. The handler then allowed the puppy to play with the ball, making it an intrinsic reward. The pups were then allowed to interact with the box. Roughly three quarters of the puppies subsequently touched the lever, and over half successfully released the ball, compared to only 6% in a control group that did not watch the human manipulate the lever.[191] Another study found that handing an object between experimenters who then used the object's name in a sentence successfully taught an observing dog each object's name, allowing the dog to subsequently retrieve the item.[192]\u000a\u000aDogs also demonstrate sophisticated social cognition by associating behavioral cues with abstract meanings.[123] One such class of social cognition involves the understanding that others are conscious agents. Research has shown that dogs are capable of interpreting subtle social cues, and appear to recognize when a human or dog's attention is focused on them. To test this, researchers devised a task in which a reward was hidden underneath one of two buckets. The experimenter then attempted to communicate with the dog to indicate the location of the reward by using a wide range of signals: tapping the bucket, pointing to the bucket, nodding to the bucket, or simply looking at the bucket.[193] The results showed that domestic dogs were better than chimpanzees, wolves, and human infants at this task, and even young puppies with limited exposure to humans performed well.[123]\u000a\u000aPsychology research has shown that humans' gaze instinctively moves to the left in order to watch the right side of a person's face, which is related to use of right hemisphere brain for facial recognition, including human facial emotions. Research at the University of Lincoln (2008) shows that dogs share this instinct when meeting a human being, and only when meeting a human being (i.e., not other animals or other dogs). As such they are the only non-primate species known to do so.[194][195]\u000a\u000aStanley Coren, an expert on dog psychology, states that these results demonstrated the social cognition of dogs can exceed that of even our closest genetic relatives, and that this capacity is a recent genetic acquisition that distinguishes the dog from its ancestor, the wolf.[123] Studies have also investigated whether dogs engaged in partnered play change their behavior depending on the attention-state of their partner.[196] Those studies showed that play signals were only sent when the dog was holding the attention of its partner. If the partner was distracted, the dog instead engaged in attention-getting behavior before sending a play signal.[196]\u000a\u000aCoren has also argued that dogs demonstrate a sophisticated theory of mind by engaging in deception, which he supports with a number of anecdotes, including one example wherein a dog hid a stolen treat by sitting on it until the rightful owner of the treat left the room.[123] Although this could have been accidental, Coren suggests that the thief understood that the treat's owner would be unable to find the treat if it were out of view. Together, the empirical data and anecdotal evidence points to dogs possessing at least a limited form of theory of mind.[123][196] Similar research has been performed by Brian Hare of Duke University, who has shown that dogs outperform both great apes as well as wolves raised by humans in reading human communicative signals.[197][198]\u000a\u000aA study found a third of dogs suffered from anxiety when separated from others.[199]\u000a\u000aA border collie named Chaser has learned the names for 1,022 toys after three years of training, so many that her trainers have had to mark the names of the objects lest they forget themselves. This is higher than Rico, another border collie who could remember at least 200 objects.[200]\u000a\u000aAlthough dogs have been the subject of a great deal of behaviorist psychology (e.g. Pavlov's dog), they do not enter the world with a psychological "blank slate".[123] Rather, dog behavior is affected by genetic factors as well as environmental factors.[123] Domestic dogs exhibit a number of behaviors and predispositions that were inherited from wolves.[123]\u000a\u000aThe Gray Wolf is a social animal that has evolved a sophisticated means of communication and social structure. The domestic dog has inherited some of these predispositions, but many of the salient characteristics in dog behavior have been largely shaped by selective breeding by humans. Thus some of these characteristics, such as the dog's highly developed social cognition, are found only in primitive forms in grey wolves.[193]\u000a\u000aThe existence and nature of personality traits in dogs have been studied (15329 dogs of 164 different breeds) and five consistent and stable "narrow traits" identified, described as playfulness, curiosity/fearlessness, chase-proneness, sociability and aggressiveness. A further higher order axis for shyness\u2013boldness was also identified.[201][202]\u000a\u000aThe average sleep time of a dog is said to be 10.1 hours per day.[203] Like humans, dogs have two main types of sleep: Slow-wave sleep, then Rapid eye movement sleep, the state in which dreams occur.[204]\u000a\u000aDogs prefer, when they are off the leash and Earth's magnetic field is calm, to urinate and defecate with their bodies aligned on a north-south axis.[205]\u000a\u000aA new study in Budapest, Hungary, has found that dogs are able to tell how big another dog is just by listening to its growl. A specific growl is used by dogs to protect their food. The research also shows that dogs do not lie about their size, and this is the first time research has shown animals can determine another's size by the sound it makes. The test, using images of many kinds of dogs, showed a small and big dog and played a growl. The result showed that 20 of the 24 test dogs looked at the image of the appropriately sized dog first and looked at it longest.[206]\u000a\u000aCompared to equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 20% smaller skulls, 30% smaller brains,[207] as well as proportionately smaller teeth than other canid species.[208] Dogs require fewer calories to function than wolves. It is thought by certain experts that the dog's limp ears are a result of atrophy of the jaw muscles.[208] The skin of domestic dogs tends to be thicker than that of wolves, with some Inuit tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather.[208]\u000a\u000aDogs tend to be poorer than wolves at observational learning, being more responsive to instrumental conditioning.[208] Feral dogs show little of the complex social structure or dominance hierarchy present in wolf packs. For example, unlike wolves, the dominant alpha pairs of a feral dog pack do not force the other members to wait for their turn on a meal when scavenging off a dead ungulate as the whole family is free to join in. For dogs, other members of their kind are of no help in locating food items, and are more like competitors.[208]\u000a\u000aFeral dogs are primarily scavengers, with studies showing that unlike their wild cousins, they are poor ungulate hunters, having little impact on wildlife populations where they are sympatric. However, feral dogs have been reported to be effective hunters of reptiles in the Galápagos Islands,[209] and free ranging pet dogs are more prone to predatory behavior toward wild animals.\u000a\u000aDomestic dogs can be monogamous.[210] Breeding in feral packs can be, but does not have to be restricted to a dominant alpha pair (such things also occur in wolf packs).[211] Male dogs are unusual among canids by the fact that they mostly seem to play no role in raising their puppies, and do not kill the young of other females to increase their own reproductive success.[209] Some sources say that dogs differ from wolves and most other large canid species by the fact that they do not regurgitate food for their young, nor the young of other dogs in the same territory.[208]\u000a\u000aHowever, this difference was not observed in all domestic dogs. Regurgitating of food by the females for the young as well as care for the young by the males has been observed in domestic dogs, dingos as well as in other feral or semi-feral dogs. Regurgitating of food by the females and direct choosing of only one mate has been observed even in those semi-feral dogs of direct domestic dog ancestry. Also regurgitating of food by males has been observed in free-ranging domestic dogs.[210][212]\u000a\u000aDogs display much greater tractability than tame wolves, and are, in general, much more responsive to coercive techniques involving fear, aversive stimuli, and force than wolves, which are most responsive toward positive conditioning and rewards.[213] Unlike tame wolves, dogs tend to respond more to voice than hand signals.[214]\u000a\u000aIn mythology, dogs often serve as pets or as watchdogs.[215]\u000a\u000aIn Greek mythology, Cerberus is a three-headed watchdog who guards the gates of Hades.[215] In Norse mythology, a bloody, four-eyed dog called Garmr guards Helheim.[215] In Persian mythology, two four-eyed dogs guard the Chinvat Bridge.[215] In Philippine mythology, Kimat who is the pet of Tadaklan, god of thunder, is responsible for lightning. In Welsh mythology, Annwn is guarded by C\u0175n Annwn.[215]\u000a\u000aIn Hindu mythology, Yama, the god of death owns two watch dogs who have four eyes. They are said to watch over the gates of Naraka.[216] Hunter god Muthappan from North Malabar region of Kerala has hunting Dog as his mount. Dogs are found in and out of the Muthappan Temple and offerings at the shrine take the form of bronze dog figurines.[217]\u000a\u000aIn Judaism and Islam, dogs are viewed as unclean scavengers.[215] In Christianity, dogs represent faithfulness.[215] In Asian countries such as China, Korea, and Japan, dogs are viewed as kind protectors.[215] The role of the dog in Chinese mythology includes a position as one of the twelve animals which cyclically represent years (the zodiacal dog).

VLed Zeppelin were a highly rated English blues-rock group and one of the most successful rock bands of the seventies. They first formed in 1968 from the remaining members of the Yardbirds, and consisted of Jimmy Page (b. 1944, guitar), Robert Plant (b. 1948, vocals), John Paul Jones (b. 1946, bass guitar, keyboards), and John Bonham (1948-1980, drums). They are one of the most influential bands in the world, becoming closely associated with the album-oriented rock (AOR) format and one of the progenitors of a style of rock music called 'heavy metal', although the band's musical output transcended heaviness,[1] with a strong blues, folk, psychedelic, classical, Celtic, and world music flavour in their recordings, and acoustic live performances. The band eschewed traditional promotional avenues in the industry, focusing on albums and concerts, without reliance on singles or television performances. The interaction of all four musicians on stage gave their live performances a visual counterpoint to voluminous intertwined harmonic and rhythmic structures of their compositions. Led Zeppelin remains one of the most popular bands of all time, having sold close to 300 million records,[2][3][4][5] and millions of concert tickets worldwide. In the United States, Led Zeppelin has achieved 111.5 million certified unit sales,[6] with all of their studio albums reaching the Billboard top ten. Since 1985, the band has had several reunions with different drummers, most notably Jason Bonham (b. 1966), son of John Bonham.\u000a\u000aTheir foundation lay in the legendary R&B outfit the Yardbirds, which guitarist Jimmy Page had joined in June 1966,[7] after initially turning down a previous invitation in February 1965. Just before joining the Yardbirds and during a break in that band's touring, Page was invited by Jeff Beck to consider the possibility of forming a 'supergroup' based around a twin-lead guitar attack which included himself on 12-string with his friend Beck, and a rhythm section featuring bass player John Paul Jones and drummer Keith Moon with the addition of keyboardist Nicky Hopkins. Jones pulled out at the last minute to be replaced by John Entwistle, but the project encountered problems over the vocal spot with both Steve Winwood and Steve Marriott all being unavailable.[8] The project recorded the Page composition 'Beck's Bolero' and a cover 'Louie, Louie' at London's IBC Studios on 16 May, before Entwistle and Moon left believing the project would go over 'like a lead zeppelin.'[9] Page finally joined the Yardbirds with Beck, but he kept the idea of a supergroup and the sarcastic phrase for future use. Along the way John Paul Jones (who was also a session musician) did string arrangements for the Yardbirds' album Little Games. In April of 1968, Page played on Donovan's Hurdy Gurdy Man album (with Jones arranging). Jones asked to be part of any new group Page may be forming.\u000a\u000aBy June 1968, the Yardbirds were drifting apart over musical direction. After a tour of the United States, on 22 June 1968, it was announced that Keith Relf and Jim McCarty were leaving the Yardbirds, with a final gig at the Luton College of Technology, on 7 July 1968,[10] members Page, bass player Chris Dreja, and manager Peter Grant resolved to continue as a blues-rock combo, initially to play out a previously booked 10-day tour of Scandinavia, dubbed by the media as the New Yardbirds. With the line-up unsettled, session drummers Clem Cattini, Aynsley Dunbar, and singer Steve Marriott were considered for auditions and Page also briefly toyed with the idea of inviting back original Yardbird Anthony 'Top' Topham on rhythm guitar.[11] On 12 July, Dreja contacted session drummer Paul Francis, but he was about to leave London for Germany and could not commit to the new line-up. Session man, arranger, bass player and keyboardist John Paul Jones then offered his services to the new group after seeing an article in Disc magazine on the Yardbird's future plans, which Page kept in mind after a phone call he received on 19 July 1968.[12] Filling the vocal and drummer spots were more of a dilemma. Due to contractual impasse Terry Reid (previously managed by Grant, now managed by Mickie Most) and B.J. Wilson (of Procol Harum) declined the respective positions, but Reid recommended an acquaintance of his, 19-year-old Midlands-born ex-Band of Joy vocalist Robert Plant. Page, Dreja and Grant went to see Plant perform live with a band called Obs-Tweedle at the Birmingham Teacher Training College on 20 July 1968, and were duly impressed. He was invited back to Page's Pangbourne boathouse to discuss joining the new group and discovered he shared similar musical tastes with Page.[13] Plant signed up and in turn recommended his former Band of Joy colleague John Bonham, who was drumming for both Chris Farlowe and Tim Rose. Page and Grant travelled to the Country Club at Hampstead, North London, on 31 July, to watch Bonham perform and both agreed he was ideal for the band, and following over 30 invitational telegrams sent by Grant to persuade him, Bonham joined.[14] In the event Dreja decided to pursue a career in photography, eventually setting up a freelance studio in New York,[15] leaving Page to find a new bass player by August 4. He promptly recruited John Paul Jones, whom he'd known for years in session work, having last worked together on the Yardbird's Little Games album in 1967. What was also in Jones' favour was his additional keyboard and arranging abilities, and valuable studio experience. All four musicians then met for a rehearsal at a basement studio, located below a record store in Gerrard Street, London on 12 August 1968 and musically gelled together as a unit immediately. Their first song attempted was the Yardbirds standard 'Train Kept a-Rollin\u02c8' followed by a run through a Band of Joy favourite, Garnet Mimms 'As Long as I Have You', 'I Can't Quit You Baby', and a version of Chester Burnett's (alias Howlin' Wolf's) 'Smokestack Lightning'. Jones later said 'As soon as I heard John Bonham play, I knew this was going to be great ... We locked together as a team immediately'.[16] Within days the group entered Lansdowne Recording Studios in Bayswater, London to record 'Jim's Blues' and 'Merry Hopkins Never Had Days Like These' with Texan-born singer P. J. Proby,[17] from an arranging session pre-booked by Jones. Page told manager Grant how well things had went, and that he wanted to get the band doing some live performances. Grant pulled out the remaining Yardbirds contracts, made some calls, and within a short while had arranged the band's first minitour ever.\u000a\u000aThis new outfit completed the Yardbirds' final contractual obligations in Scandinavia, with their first gig at the Teen Clubs - Box 45, Gladsaxe in Denmark on 7 September 1968, at 7.30 pm,[18] followed by a second show at the Brøndby Pop Club in Copenhagen. With the tour concluded on 16 September, the band then entered Olympic Studios in Barnes, West London recording their own eponymous debut album within 30 hours on a budget of only £1750 (including artwork), with sessions starting on 27 September, assisted by engineer Glyn Johns.[19] The first two compositions recorded were 'Babe I'm Gonna Leave You' and 'I Can't Quit You Baby', on 4-track tape. Although originally booked in the studio as the Yardbirds, the album eventually released as Led Zeppelin, and produced by Page, showcased their brand of folk, eastern and blues-rock fusion with Plant's powerful vocal style and Page's accomplished guitar work being tight and urgent. Page wanted the sound as close as possible to those early live shows; he didn't want anything that couldn't be reproduced live effectively with just the four of them. Part of the astonishing presence and depth of those recordings came from the way he placed microphones in the room, to get varying sounds of vibrancy and decay. 'Distance is depth', was Page\u2019s maxim. The tracks recorded also displayed Page's musical credence in 'light and shade' \u2013 music punctuated with both quieter and heavier dynamics,[20] and two in particular - 'Communication Breakdown' and 'Dazed and Confused' \u2013 have served as templates for much subsequent rock music. With the recordings concluded they then performed a series of gigs in the United Kingdom, beginning with the Mayfair Ballroom in Newcastle on 4 October, and other bookings subsequently followed such as the Marquee on 18 October 1968 and Liverpool University on 19 October,[21] before changing their name permanently to Led Zeppelin, based on a humorous idiom of Keith Moon as far back as May 1966.[22] Moon had often used the phrase 'go over like a lead zeppelin', which Page liked and Grant promoted with a dropped 'a' to preclude any mispronunciation.[23] On October 22, Grant and Page then registered the band's own publishing company under the tongue-in-cheek name of Superhype Music, Inc. to ensure all songwriting royalties would accrue independently.[24] The first public appearance under their new moniker was at Surrey University on 25 October 1968. On 28 October, Led Zeppelin was signed to Atlantic Records by label Executive Vice-President Jerry Wexler in New York,[25] at the recommendation of Dusty Springfield and producer Bert Burns for a then record negotiated advance of US$200,000 - an unprecedented amount for a new group whose first album nobody had yet heard.[26] Wexler's decision was also assisted by Page's and Jones' session reputations as well as the announced dissolution of label supergroup Cream, preceding November 1968. Page had particularly sought out Atlantic Records because of its strong historical background with blues, soul and jazz artists, as opposed to other rock acts during the 1960s that were being signed to Elektra (originally a folk label) and Atco (Atlantic's subsidiary pop label).\u000a\u000aEven more important, though, were the contract terms that Grant secured: essentially, Led Zeppelin held control of key clauses. They alone would decide when they would release albums and tour, and they had final say over the contents and design of each album. They also would decide how much they would do to promote each release (not that much beyond tours, though those would be extensive) and which tracks to select as singles (Grant and the band insisted none, despite the label's many unauthorized attempts).[27] A major band would be working for itself, not for a company or for management (Led Zeppelin had no formal contract with Grant). With the album now in the hands of Atlantic Records, Grant resolved that they should focus on the US market (albums were usually released and promoted first in the US before the UK), and after a few appearances, Grant also concluded that formulaic television programmes were not the best medium to highlight the band\u2019s musical dynamics. This inevitably led to a lack of airplay in their early days, but in the longer term created the sense of mystique that was to sustain them over the coming decade. Grant's promotional philosophy was that if a person wanted to see or hear the band, they had to go to their concert and experience them. Consequently, the only connection the audience had with the band was through the records and the concerts. The band's skill at extending and improvising on their studio record repertoire elevated their live shows to something very different from playing their albums. This had the effect of making fans feel like they were members of an exclusive club.[28] Performances would also extend out to four hours whereas most concerts by other artists during the 1960s would typically only average 45 minutes. The unwillingness by the band to play by standard industry rules also meant an uneasy relationship with the press, which later resulted in the eventual employment of a full-time publicist and only select interviews given by group members.\u000a\u000aLed Zeppelin were originally scheduled to appear on The Rolling Stones Rock 'n' Roll Circus TV special filmed at Intertel Studios in December; however, Mick Jagger felt their sound was too competitive for the line-up after hearing a demo tape of their first album, and replaced them at the last minute with Jethro Tull. That was when Grant turned his attention to America. He arranged for Led Zeppelin to perform in various places in America during Christmas. At first the band members felt troubled at the thought of being away from their families during Christmas, but Grant felt that this tour would do wonders for the band's success. On 26 December 1968, they began their first US tour with a concert at the Denver Auditorium in Denver, Colorado, before launching into a cross-country tour of venues handpicked by Grant from his experiences road-managing the Jeff Beck Group - five nights at the Whiskey A Go-Go in Los Angeles, four at the Fillmore West in San Francisco, three at the Boston Tea Party, supporting the likes of Vanilla Fudge, Iron Butterfly, and Alice Cooper,[29], and the Grande Ballroom in Detroit. Grant gave local FM radio stations white label copies of their debut album in advance for rotation before the tour reached each city, ensuring promotion at a listener level. They were an immediate sensation and midway through that first US tour, on 12 January, the group's debut album Led Zeppelin with its trademark Hindenburg cover art, was released in the US, and it ascended to number ten on the Billboard charts. British underground counter-culture newspaper, OZ, enthused, 'it was one of those rare LPs that so defy immediate classification or description, simply because [they are] so obviously a turning point in rock'.[30] They performed frequently, initially in clubs and ballrooms, then in larger auditoriums and eventually stadiums as their popularity strengthened. At the Fillmore East on 31 January, Led Zeppelin's performance was so intense, and the audience reaction so fanatical, that the headliners Iron Butterfly delayed its own onstage arrival by 45 minutes in the hope that the crowd would calm down. Led Zeppelin never went out as a support group again.[31]\u000a\u000aOn 21 March 1969, they made their only live UK TV appearance on a pilot BBC rock show, How Late It Is,[32] followed by a performance of 'Dazed and Confused' on Supershow in Staines, London on 25 March. As the group began its second US tour on 18 April, this time at the New York University Jazz festival, 'Good Times Bad Times' made the US Billboard charts at number 80. On 10 May, Led Zeppelin made its belated UK debut and rose to a peak of number six on the charts.[33] Over the summer of 1969 they played a number of prestigious gigs \u2013 the London Playhouse Theatre for BBC Radio's In Concert show (27 June), the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music (28 June), the Pop Proms (29 June)[34] and the Newport Jazz and Blues Festival in the US during July.[35] Throughout this time they also played many BBC sessions, later compiled and released as the BBC Sessions double CD set.[36] These show them to have a repertoire not only rooted in the blues, but effortlessly able to incorporate influences from folk, jazz and world music. On 12 October, the band appeared at a 'Sunday Lyceum' concert promoted by entrepreneur Tony Stratton-Smith, and received the then highest fee ever paid to a UK band for a one-off concert.[37]\u000a\u000aLed Zeppelin II, recorded in various locations[38] as they criss-crossed the US during 1969, was the album which firmly established them as one of the world's biggest rock bands. Advance orders for the album alone topped 400,000 units and when it was released it became Atlantic Records\u2019 fastest selling album at 100,000 copies a week.[39] Symbolically dislodging the Beatles' Abbey Road from the top of the charts on both sides of the Atlantic,[40] it remained in the US charts for 138 weeks and cemented their reputation as the world's most successful hard-rock artists. Its finest moment was arguably 'Whole Lotta Love', with its timeless opening riff and experimental midsection. The song itself became a rock anthem and also appeared as a single in the US, where it rose to number four despite the group's reservations.[41] Practically all of 1969 and the first few months of 1970 were spent touring. They played the Royal Albert Hall on 9 January. On 28 February, they changed their name to the tongue-in-cheek title of the Nobs after Eva von Zeppelin threatened litigation for using her family's surname, if they performed in Denmark.[42] She never followed through with her threat in any subsequent tours. Upon their arrival for their concert at Mid South Coliseum on 17 April, Mayor Henry Loeb of Memphis, Tennessee bestowed members of the band honorary citizenship of the city.[43]\u000a\u000aBefore recording their next album, Page and Plant spent a few idyllic weeks in 1970 writing in a rustic remote Welsh cottage named Bron-Yr-Aur, later immortalized in two song titles. Led Zeppelin III was more folk-based than its predecessors, but still had a high quota of hard rock songs such as 'Immigrant Song' and 'Out on the Tiles'. 'Immigrant Song' was released as a single in the US, where it ascended to number 16.[44] The album also contained some superb acoustic material, and appeared in a variegated sleeve featuring an inner rotating disc.[45] Though some music critic reviews were typically indifferent, sales were again outstanding and it topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. Debut performances for the new songs came with a brace of Icelandic shows before Led Zeppelin headlined the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music on 27 June, with an audience of over 150,000 in attendance.[46] By now, with the Beatles having split and the Rolling Stones in tax exile, Led Zeppelin was indisputably the world's top rock group. This was confirmed on 16 September, when the band was voted Top Group in the annual Melody Maker poll, ending the Beatles' unbroken eight year reign with that magazine.[47]\u000a\u000aOn 5 March 1971, Led Zeppelin began a series of 'thank you' club shows for its British fans in response to their support during the band's early performances in 1968. They agreed to play for the original admission fee for that year.[48] The tour started with the band's first concert in Ireland and in Belfast fans were given the honour of being the first to hear 'Stairway to Heaven' performed live. Their tour of Italy was interrupted when a police-instigated riot on 5 July, prematurely ended a concert at Vigorelli Stadium in Milan.[49] The untitled fourth album, known unofficially as Led Zeppelin IV and also as Four Symbols ( ) or Untitled, was released that year and continued the practice of coupling hard rock songs like 'Black Dog' and 'Rock and Roll' (which climbed to numbers 15 and 47 respectively on the US charts) with subtler material such as 'The Battle of Evermore', which featured Sandy Denny and reflected Plant's ongoing preoccupation with Celtic folklore,[50] and the ethereal 'Going to California'. The album also contained the band's eight-minute-and-one-second magnum opus, 'Stairway to Heaven', with its ballad-like verses and scorching lead break becoming the group's most identifiable anthem, which would populate 'all time' song polls and radio airwaves for decades even though it was never officially released as a single. 'Stairway to Heaven' is often quoted as being the most requested FM radio song of all time, and as a musical statement it encapsulated all the group's styles into one unified package. Led Zeppelin IV topped the album charts in the UK, but only reached number two in the US, perhaps because of the radical decision not to list the band's name anywhere on the packaging.[51] The band not only wanted the album to be untitled, but wanted nothing written on it; no credits or any text anywhere on the album, on its inside or outside sleeves. They released the album with no indication of who they were in order to prove that their music was the sole focal point.[52] They were eventually talked out of it by Atlantic Records and there were credits added to the inside paper sleeve, but still, nothing was written on the front cover to identify the album or who put it out, and the album was left untitled by the band.\u000a\u000aFrom late 1971 to all of 1972, the band spent months touring the world. Led Zeppelin played a charity concert at Hiroshima's Shiei Taiikukan on 27 September 1971, for victims of the Second World War atomic bombing and were awarded Peace Medals and the Civil Charter by the city.[53] The band used Japan to try out as yet uncommitted to vinyl plus some unexpected cover versions. On 14 February, they were refused admission to Singapore because of their long hair which the band refused to cut.[54] They began their first and so-far only Australasian tour on 16 February, culminating on a return trip to Bombay, India, to record with local orchestras.[55] A planned concert at London's Waterloo train station had to be cancelled in July due to logistical problems involving conflicting train running times.[56] Before the band commences their 1972 summer tour of the US, Grant initiated the 90/10 policy on gate receipts with promoters and agents which becomes a standard percentage in the music industry, with almost no opposition due to the audience drawing power the band now had.[57] The drawing power was further confirmed when all 110,000 tickets for their 24-date December 1972-January 1973 UK tour sold out in just four hours.[58]\u000a\u000aHouses of the Holy was released in April 1973 and again topped the album charts on both sides of the Atlantic the same month. This was arguably their most diverse album, with tracks ranging from high energy rock to reggae, funk and folky ballads. It went further with experimentation than previous releases, with expanded tracks and versatile use of synthesisers and Mellotron orchestration. Highlights of the album include the Gothic 'No Quarter' and the ballad 'The Rain Song'. The striking orange gatefold album cover of Houses of the Holy featured images of children climbing up the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, based upon Arthur C. Clarke's novel Childhood's End.[59] Again the band's name was absent from the front cover. It also marked the band's inaugural artwork with design company Hipgnosis. The month after its release, Led Zeppelin opened at the Braves Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia on 4 May, performing to over 49,236 people, the largest audience in that state's history. The following day, Led Zeppelin's concert at Tampa Stadium (now Houlihan's Stadium), Florida, on 5 May, broke the US box office record, previously held by the Beatles for their 1965 Shea Stadium appearance. 56,800 people attended grossing for the band US$309,000.[60]\u000a\u000aFor the first time and on subsequent US tours, the group avoided long trips to interstate venues by road, by leasing a full-sized Boeing 720B jet, nicknamed The Starship.[61] 'It's like a floating palace,' remarked Plant on his first Starship flight. In line with an expanded stage show, the band's image also changed as members began to wear elaborate, flamboyant clothing. In July 1973 a series of performances at New York's Madison Square Garden was filmed for possible inclusion in a future motion picture. Film-maker Joe Massot and his crew recorded the band's performances and some offstage and backstage shots. Sometime later, they also filmed a 'fantasy scene' for each of the band members, scenes supposedly derived from each of the band members' thoughts and fantasies. During the final night's Garden performance, US$203,000 of the band's money from gate receipts went missing from a safety deposit box at the Drake Hotel. Tour manager Richard Cole had stored the band's cash in the box, but when he later went to check on it, the money was gone. It was the single highest theft from a deposit box in Manhattan's history and was never recovered.[62] Over a million people saw their 34-date American tour, grossing over US$3 million. The band had begun work on a film during this tour and the extended 12-month break afterwards, at which time Robert Plant had minor vocal cord surgery and John Paul Jones considered leaving over the heavy touring schedule, but was persuaded to remain by Grant.[63]\u000a\u000aPage and Grant both felt it would be more financially and creatively rewarding if they went ahead and materialized their own label. As their five-year deal with Atlantic Records was about to expire, on 10 May 1974, the band and their manager launched their own Swan Song Records label and secured a distribution deal via Atlantic, signing artists including Bad Company, the Pretty Things, Maggie Bell, Midnight Flyer, Dave Edmunds, Sad Café and Wildlife.[64] Swan Song also assisted in sponsoring the production of Monty Python's film The Holy Grail. The record label's logo lettering used two stylised white swans, was set with a painting called Evening: Fall of Day (1869) by William Rimmer, featuring a winged Apollo rising from the earth at sunset.[65] Extravagant launch parties were thrown at Chislehurst Caves in Kent (31 October), at New York's Four Seasons Hotel, and the Bel Air Hotel in Los Angeles[66] and then, in March 1975, a lavish die-cut packaged double album was released entitled Physical Graffiti. Containing tracks stretching back to the start of the decade alongside new material recorded at Headley Grange, this again exhibited their eclectic abilities, containing many fine songs, particularly the eastern inspired epic 'Kashmir' and the funky 'Trampled Under Foot', which climbed to number 38 in the US. At one point Physical Graffiti, which topped the album charts on both sides of the Atlantic, was selling at the rate of 500 copies per hour in one New York store alone, and on 25 March all six Led Zeppelin albums were on the Billboard Top 200 album charts.[67] Led Zeppelin again toured the US in early 1975 and then in April, 51,000 tickets for three concerts at London's Earls Court sold out in two hours.[68] They ended up playing five four-hour shows there the following month accompanied by a display of laser beams, neon signs, coloured light show, dry ice, Ediphor screen and a 70,000 watt PA system not previously seen or heard on their previous UK tours.[69] The concerts would become legendary, and tapings of the shows were included in the Led Zeppelin DVD nearly thirty years later.\u000a\u000aBy now though, their monetary success was becoming almost counter-productive and in June they were forced into tax exile in Switzerland.[70] After Earls Court, the band began a short overseas holiday with Page had flying to Marrakesh to meet up with Plant, who was travelling with his wife Maureen and family. Veering off the tourist paths, Page and Plant rented a Range Rover and drove deep into Morocco. The mission was to discover street music, to soak up the experiences that might enhance the next album. They travelled through Ovazazatte, Zagora, Tagora, Tafraoute, the Atlas Mountains, moving north through Casablanca and Tangier, with a plan to meet up with the rest of the band in Montreux, Switzerland, for rehearsals for a projected tour of the United States. While on the return journey Page detoured to visit southern Italy while Plant and his family continued the holiday in Greece. However, a serious car crash on a Greek island mountainside in which Robert Plant and his wife were badly injured, on 4 August 1975, prevented any live appearances in the second half of the year. Maureen Plant was driving her husband, their children, and Page's daughter Scarlet in a rented Austin Mini sedan on Rhodes, Greece, when the car veered off the road and crashed. All tours were cancelled and Plant spent the rest of the year recuperating from his shattered elbow and ankle, going first to the Channel Islands and then to Switzerland. Unable to return and stay at any length in the UK, the band reconvened in Malibu, California, where the forced hiatus allowed much of the material for their next album, Presence, to be composed. It was recorded within eighteen days in November, at Musicland Studios in Munich, with Plant restricted to singing in a wheelchair, but they again topped the album charts on both sides of the Atlantic on its release in April 1976.[71] The sound gravitated towards more straightforward, guitar-based arrangements, departing from the acoustic ballads and intricate keyboard work featured on their previous albums. Though it eventually did not sell as many units in total as the previous band releases, it contains two bona fide classics in the epic shapes of 'Nobody's Fault but Mine' and 'Achilles Last Stand'. Jimmy Page in later interviews has cited Presence as his favourite album.[72]\u000a\u000aTheir long-awaited film The Song Remains the Same was given a charity premiere at the Ritz Theatre in Manhattan on 20 October 1976, with proceeds going to the Save the Children Fund. Directed by Peter Clifton, it featured lengthy live footage alongside individual fantasy sequences: John Bonham raced a dragster, Robert Plant rescued a fair maiden, John Paul Jones appeared as a masked night rider, while Page climbed a Scottish mountain on the shores of Loch Ness in search of Father Time. A double soundtrack album featuring live versions of 'Rock and Roll', 'Dazed and Confused' and 'Stairway to Heaven', was released the same month and predictably topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic,[73] despite being far from the best recorded testament to their onstage talents circa 1973. Preparations began at Manticore Studios in January 1977, for their eleventh tour of the US which started on 1 April, at the Dallas Memorial Auditorium in Texas, and was slated to extend for forty-nine concerts across America, for an estimated 1.3 million ticket holders. It was the tour in which Robert Plant felt he had something to prove to the fans after his accident. Due to aircraft engine problems, the Starship was replaced by a Boeing 707 dubbed Caesar's Chariot for all flights between cities. The tour included an extended acoustic set, and 'Battle of Evermore' was performed for the first time live with John Paul Jones singing Sandy Denny's original parts. The band played before a crowd of over 76,229 at the Pontiac Silverdome in Michigan on 30 April, breaking Led Zeppelin\u2019s own attendance record set in 1973,[74] followed by a six-night stint at Madison Square Garden in June. Led Zeppelin were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for 'Outstanding Contribution to British Music' on 12 May, but by late 1977 despite continuing to win awards the band had lost ground in the media spotlight particularly in the UK, having been unable to tour for over two years. Following a performance at the 'Day on the Green' festival in Oakland, Plant was informed while in New Orleans of the tragic death of his seven-year-old son Karac on 26 July from a respiratory infection.[75] Grief-stricken, Plant flew back to England and the rest of the tour was cancelled, forcing the band to take further unscheduled time off the road. Grant eventually persuaded Plant to rejoin the band, at a meeting at London's Royal Garden Hotel in April 1978, and in May 1978 they had reunited to rehearse together at Clearwell Castle, in the Forest of Dean. They then played a pair of warm-up shows in Copenhagen, followed by their last UK dates (their first since 1975) which took place on 4 and 11 August 1979, when they attracted over 380,000 people to the Knebworth festivals in Hertfordshire, with a 23-song set.[76] The concerts were a huge success. Page, feeling renewed after the concerts, said, 'We can still reach our fans without the wear and tear on our own bodies and psyches.'\u000a\u000aTheir penultimate studio album, In Through the Out Door, recorded at Polar Studios in Stockholm during December 1978, was very different in style to its predecessors, being heavily influenced by Jones' songwriting and use of synthesisers. The standout tracks were 'In the Evening', 'Carouselambra', 'I'm Gonna Crawl' and the balladic tribute to Plant's son, 'All My Love'. The album was released packaged in a plain brown paper bag, with one of six different sleeves inside,[77] and debuted at number one on the UK and US charts. As a result, Led Zeppelin's entire catalogue made the Billboard Top 200 album chart between the weeks of October 27 and November 3, outdoing the band's similar previous feat in 1975.[78] In December 1979, Jones, Bonham, and Plant all performed at a London benefit charity for the United Nations, Concert for the People of Kampuchea. The band picked up eight awards at the annual Melody Maker Reader's Poll in December before commencing rehearsals at the Rainbow Theatre in April, for a brief low-key European 14-day tour performing in Switzerland, Germany, Holland, Belgium, and Austria, undertaken in June and July 1980 with new tour manager Phil Carlo. The band adopted a playful and generous spirit about the tour, with Page even handling some of the stage introductions himself. Featuring a redolent back-to-basics set which opened with 'Train Kept a-Rollin\u02c8', and culminating at the Berlin Eissporthalle on July 7, 1980, where they concluded their set with a longer-than-usual version of 'Whole Lotta Love'.[79] It was coincidentally twelve years to the day after the Yardbirds' (with Relf and McCarty) final show. On 24 September 1980, Led Zeppelin met at Bray Studios to begin rehearsals for an upcoming 19-date North American tour, promoted as 'Led Zeppelin - The 80s: Part One', which included new songs added to the set such as 'Carouselambra'. The band's plan also included a return to the US West Coast in early 1981 and a UK tour in the spring, and the recording of a new, riff-intense album. Their career was however brought to an abrupt end when John Bonham accidentally asphyxiated in his sleep after a prolonged drinking session during rehearsals which ended at Page's Old Mill House, Windsor, property on 25 September 1980.[80] Widely acclaimed as the greatest rock drummer ever, Bonham's unique sound would have been difficult to replace and the remaining members, having met at London's Savoy Hotel to discuss future plans, eventually announced the band's dissolution and the cancellation of a US tour, on 4 December 1980: 'We wish it to be known that the loss of our dear friend, and the deep sense of undivided harmony felt by ourselves and our manager, have led us to decide that we could not continue as we were.'[81] To fulfil contractual commitments, the remaining members of the band decided to drop the option of a chronologically ordered live anthology in favour of a career-spanning out-takes collection called Coda, which appeared in December 1982. It included two tracks taken from the band's performance at the Royal Albert Hall in 1970, one each from the Led Zeppelin III and Houses of the Holy sessions, and three from the In Through the Out Door sessions. It also featured a 1976 John Bonham percussion instrumental with electronic embellishments added by Jimmy Page, called 'Bonzo's Montreux'. With no working band to promote, and Peter Grant in semi-retirement from the music industry, Swan Song Records was eventually wound up in late 1983.\u000a\u000aAfter the split, Plant, Page and Jones concentrated on developing their solo and production careers, though rumours of and actual reunions were never distant. In 1981, there were plans for both Page and Plant to team up with Alan White and Chris Squire of Yes to form XYZ (ex-Yes Zeppelin), but conflicting issues on who should manage the supergroup (Peter Grant or Brian Lane) and Plant's decision not to proceed, ended the project prematurely after a number of demos were recorded.[82]\u000a\u000aOn 13 July 1985, the three remaining members of Zeppelin, along with Paul Martinez (from Plant's band) on bass, Tony Thompson (of Chic) on drums, and Phil Collins (who had to fly over after his performance at Wembley) on drums, appeared at the Live Aid festival at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia. They played a 20-minute set and performed 'Rock and Roll', 'Whole Lotta Love', and 'Stairway to Heaven'. Plant was hoarse from four consecutive nights of singing and a morning rehearsal, the others were under-rehearsed and plagued by a lack of foldback.[83] Plans for a projected reunion and world tour in January 1986, were cancelled after replacement drummer Tony Thompson broke his arm in a motorway accident on his way to Real World Studios, near Bath, on the second day of rehearsals.[84] Plant handled bass chores while Jones played keyboards.\u000a\u000aIn 1988, Page also contributed to Plant's Now and Zen track 'Tall Cool One', which featured a medley of Led Zeppelin samples. On 17 April 1988, at the Hammersmith Odeon, Page joined Plant's tour for a blistering encore featuring 'Trampled Underfoot', 'Gambler's Blues'/'I Can't Quit You Baby'/'Since I've Been Loving You', 'Misty Mountain Hop', and 'Rock and Roll'. There were also subsequent one-off reunions at the Atlantic Records' 40th anniversary concert at Madison Square Garden (14 May 1988),[85] with Jason Bonham filling his father's shoes on drums. A 12-hour tribute concert for Atlantic Records, which came to a climax with Zeppelin's performance, Jason Bonham played well, but the night is generally considered very ordinary. The rehearsal was (reportedly) brilliant. The evening arrived with the band better-rehearsed than they had been at Live Aid; but the concert ran late, upsetting fragile nerves. The sound feed for the TV broadcast completely lost the keyboards, which made 'Kashmir' sound rather thin. The set list was: 'Kashmir', 'Heartbreaker'/'Whole Lotta Love' (the Knebworth 1979 arrangement), 'Misty Mountain Hop', and 'Stairway to Heaven'.\u000a\u000aIn November 1989, the band played at Carmen Plant's 21st birthday Party, once again with Jason on drums. The set list was 'Trampled Underfoot', 'Misty Mountain Hop', and 'Rock and Roll'. The band also reformed for Jason Bonham's wedding reception (28 April 1990), playing 'Bring It On Home', 'Rock and Roll', 'Sick Again', 'Custard Pie', and Jerry Lee Lewis' 'It'll Be Me'.[86] Both this and the previous performance were said to be outstanding. On 30 June 1990, Page joined Plant onstage at Knebworth Park for the Silver Clef winners charity concert (despite rumours and even the official promotion announcing Led Zeppelin's presence, Jones was nowhere to be found), performing 'Misty Mountain Hop', the first-ever Page-led performance of 'Wearing and Tearing', and 'Rock and Roll'. Page had stood on the side of the stage earlier as Plant's band covered 'Immigrant Song' and 'Going to California'.\u000a\u000aAs producer, Page spent most of the 1990s remastering the entire Led Zeppelin back catalogue including the two-volume Led Zeppelin box set and three-disc Remasters set.[87] The Box Set also included four previously unreleased tracks, including the song 'Travelling Riverside Blues', with an accompanying video resulting in heavy rotation on MTV. In January 1991, the members of Zeppelin met with Peter Grant to discuss a reunion tour to promote these new compilation releases. Lighting and sound companies were contacted, and stadiums were quietly reserved, with a potential involvement with drummer Mike 'Puffy' Bordin. After badgering Plant in public and private about the reunion, Page thought he had finally convinced him to go along with it. Both Page and Jones had expressed varying degrees of enthusiasm for the idea. But Plant, after agreeing to the tour and breaking for lunch, came back one hour later and said no. Plant was not ready to commit.[88]\u000a\u000aPage, Plant, Charlie Jones, and Michael Lee performed on 17 April 1994 at the Alexis Korner Blues Show in Buxton, England. The set list: 'Baby Please Don't Go', 'I Can't Quit You Baby', 'I've Been Down So Long', 'That's Why I Love You', and 'Train Kept a-Rollin'. Jimmy Page and Robert Plant then took this one step further by participating in two invitation-only MTV Unplugged concerts on 25 and 26 August 1994,[89] later released as No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded. The success of the venture later prompted the pair to undertake a year-long world tour with a Middle Eastern orchestra, comprising 115 concerts, reinterpreting the band's songs.[90] Led Zeppelin was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995[91] and received a Liftetime Achievement Award at the 42nd Annual Ivor Novello Awards in May 1997.[92] After many years away from the public spotlight, former manager Peter Grant died on 21 November 1995.[93] In 1998, Steve Albini produced an album of new Page-Plant compositions, Walking Into Clarksdale, released with an intentional low-fidelity production, to mixed reviews.[94] Plant parted company with Page during 1999 to concentrate on his solo career, going back to his earlier R&B and West Coast roots.[95] In October 1999, Page performed a series of shows with the Black Crowes, recording an double album's worth of Led Zeppelin covers. Page has never ruled out reforming Led Zeppelin.\u000a\u000aThe RIAA announced, on 29 November 1999, that the band were only the third act in music history to achieve four or more certified Diamond albums.[96] VH1 named the group the number one 'Greatest Artist of Hard Rock'.[97] A lavish four-hour retrospective double DVD of Led Zeppelin was issued in 2003, and swiftly became the best-selling music DVD of all time. At the same time a triple live CD, How the West Was Won, a set recorded in 1972 that is superior in performance to The Song Remains the Same, was released. It opens with the powerful 'Immigrant Song' and contains a superb 24-minute version of 'Whole Lotta Love' and many other classics from their first three albums. In February 2005, Led Zeppelin received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award[98] and in 2006 was awarded the Polar Music Prize.[99] Led Zeppelin were formally inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in September 2006.[100] On 10 December 2007 the surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited (along with former drummer John Bonham's son Jason) for the Ahmet Ertegun charity tribute show at The O in London.[101] The 16-song set was part of a benefit concert for the Ahmet Ertegun Education Fund, which provides scholarships for gifted children. According to Tixdaq, the Led Zeppelin reunion produced the highest average resale price (£707·97) for any concert ticket in 2007.[102] Rumours persist of a future world tour, with millions of dollars from promoters on offer. Led Zeppelin became the first band inducted into the people's choice Hall of Fame at WNCX in Cleveland, Ohio, on 3 March.[103]\u000a\u000aOn 7 June 2008, Page and Jones joined Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl and drummer Taylor Hawkins onstage at Wembley Stadium to perform two Led Zeppelin tracks, 'Rock and Roll' preceded by 'Ramble On'. Dave Grohl has been a long-time Led Zeppelin fan.[104]. The BBC reported on 26 August 2008, that Page, Jones, and Jason Bonham have been recording material which may become a new 'Led Zeppelin' project, although Plant has not been mentioned.[105] It was later revealed that a number of singers, including Creed vocalist Scott Stapp and Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler, were auditioned but declined - Plant having decided to record another album with Alison Krauss. In 2013, Page announced that the entire Led Zeppelin catalogue would be reissued with previously unreleased tracks in 2014.\u000a\u000a2014 saw the release of the remastered Led Zeppelin catalogue with bonus tracks in multiple CD, vinyl, and digital formats, including limited edition Super Deluxe Boxed Sets. Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin II, Led Zeppelin III were issued on 3 June 2014.[106]\u000a\u000aDespite the public's ever changing tastes in musical styles, Led Zeppelin has managed to retain its popularity. The concert film The Song Remains the Same is still a staple of midnight cinema screenings, and tunes like 'Stairway to Heaven', 'Kashmir', 'Black Dog', 'Whole Lotta Love' and 'Rock and Roll' are still in heavy rotation on classic rock broadcast playlists. In February 1989, Los Angeles radio station KLOS began an hour long regular broadcast of Led Zeppelin songs every night. On 1 January 1990, an FM radio station in St. Petersburg, Florida, WKRL, began broadcasting 'Stairway to Heaven' for twenty-four hours as a prelude to an all Led Zeppelin format.[107] In 2005, the magazine Guitar World conducted a readers poll in which 'Stairway to Heaven' was voted as having the greatest guitar solo of all time.[108] XM Satellite Radio launched XM LED on 8 November 2007, an artist-exclusive channel dedicated to Led Zeppelin (within 12 months it would be renamed Led Zeppelin Radio). After much delay, Led Zeppelin's entire back catalogue was available for digital download via iTunes on 13 November 2007. Led Zeppelin has been the subject of many tribute CDs, notably Enconium: A Tribute to Led Zeppelin released by Atlantic Records in 1995. There have also been classical, reggae, jazz, heavy metal, and rockabilly artists who have also released tribute albums, and an all-'Stairway to Heaven' tribute CD by Australian ABC television programme The Money or the Gun. Studio band Far Corporation released their version of 'Stairway to Heaven' which reached number eight on the UK singles chart, in 1985. Led Zeppelin has also been the subject of numerous cover bands, such as Lez Zeppelin, an all-girl tribute act.\u000a\u000aThe music of Led Zeppelin has been used on soundtracks, although the band has consistently been protective of issuing blanket licences. The first song to appear in any film was 'How Many More Times', used in the Vietnam War-era movie Homer (1970), directed by John Trent.[109] 'Immigrant Song' has been the most widely used track, appearing in School of Rock, Shrek the Third and One Day in September. Others include 'Communication Breakdown' in Small Soldiers and 'Babe I'm Gonna Leave You' in the television series One Tree Hill. Two films which have used the most number of Led Zeppelin tracks have been Dogtown and Z-Boys with 'Achilles Last Stand', 'Nobody's Fault but Mine', and 'Hots on for Nowhere' and the Cameron Crowe cinematic release Almost Famous with 'That's the Way', 'Tangerine', 'Misty Mountain Hop', and 'The Rain Song'. The theme song of long running British music television programme Top of the Pops used a cover of 'Whole Lotta Love' by Collective Consciousness Society (CCS), which featured Alexis Korner.

VThe United States of America, called the United States, U.S.A, U.S., US, or America, is a nation mainly located in North America, between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, between Canada and Mexico. The country is a federal constitutional republic[1] that consists of 48 contiguous states as well as the two non-contiguous states Alaska and Hawaii. The current head of state and government is President Barack Obama, who was elected in 2008.\u000a\u000aThe United States occupies a band across the entire width of North America, and includes Alaska, a peninsula at the northwest extreme of North America, and Hawaii, a group of volcanic islands in the north Pacific Ocean.\u000a\u000aThe Atlantic Coastal Plain occupies the eastern seaboard of the United States. The plain very gradually rises westward to the Appalachian Mountains, and is drained by a large number of rivers. Some of these rivers are very economically and historically important. The main river systems draining the east side of the Appalachians to the Atlantic Ocean are the Connecticut River, the Hudson River, the Delaware River, the Susquehanna River, the Potomac River, the James River, the Santee River, and the Savannah River. The peninsular part of Florida extends southwards, and separates the Atlantic Ocean from the Gulf of Mexico.\u000a\u000aThe Appalachian Mountains, which run southwest to northeast near the east coast, are an ancient mountain range which existed before the separation of North America. Due to their great age, the Appalachians are low rolling mountains, reaching a peak altitude at Mount Mitchell in North Carolina of 2037 m (6,684 feet).\u000a\u000aWest of the Appalachian Mountains is a very large broad basin which extends west to the Rocky Mountains. Along the northern boundary of the United States is a series of 5 large lakes, called the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes ultimately drain to the Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lawrence River in Canada. Most of the rivers which drain into the Great Lakes are rather small. South of the Great Lakes drainage is the Ohio River valley. The Ohio River drains much of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky to the Mississippi River. The Ohio River is formed by the confluence of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. South of the Ohio River, the Tennessee River drains some of Kentucky, most of Tennessee, and northern parts of the states of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, from the Appalachian Mountains into the Ohio River just upstream of the Ohio's discharge to the Mississippi River.\u000a\u000aThe Mississippi River runs from north to south, dividing the United States. The Mississippi River discharges into the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana. The conventional beginning of the Mississippi River is in Minnesota. The main tributaries of the Mississippi are the Ohio River, the Tennessee River, the Arkansas River, and the Missouri River. With its tributaries, the Mississippi River drains the central half of the United States from the crest of the Appalachians to the crest of the Rocky Mountains. East of the Mississippi River, and for some distance west, the natural vegetation of the area was deciduous forest. At some distance west of the Mississippi River, the forest gives way to open prairie, a region known as the Great Plains. The Great Plains slowly rise westwards toward the Rocky Mountains, a high large mountain range extending from New Mexico, through Colorado, Wyoming, and into Montana. The Rockies are significantly younger and higher than the Appalachians; the highest point is at Mount Elbert in Colorado, at 4401 m (14,440 feet) above mean sea level.\u000a\u000aWest of the Rockies lie a number of smaller mountain ranges and basins, forming the Basin and Range country. The northern part of this region, primarily in Montana and Idaho, is well-watered and drains to the Pacific Ocean through the Columbia River , its major tributary the Snake River, and their tributaries. To the south lies the Great Basin, which, due to its low rainfall, has no drainage to an ocean. The Great Basin covers most of Nevada and much of Utah, and extends into the surrounding states. In prehistoric time, much of the Great Basin was covered by two large lakes, Lake Bonneville and Lake Lahontan, which drained into the Snake River, but as the region became desert, the lakes lost their outlet and shrank. Utah's Great Salt Lake is the main remnant of Lake Bonneville, and various small salt lakes in Nevada are all that remains of Lake Lahontan. To the south of the Great Basin are the small mountain ranges of New Mexico and Arizona, which nominally[2] drain through the Gila River and the Colorado River to the Gulf of California.\u000a\u000aFurther west lie the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, and the Cascades of Washington, Oregon and far northern California. The Sierra Nevada was formed geologically recently by uplift as the North American tectonic plate gradually absorbed smaller terranes. The highest point in the contiguous United States is Mount Whitney, at 4421 m (14,505 feet)in the southern Sierra Nevada. The Cascades are volcanic in origin, and still have various active volcanos as the Juan de Fuca Plate is subducted below the North American Plate. The most recent large eruption was the explosion in 1980 of Mount Saint Helens in Washington. Lassen Peak in California was volcanically active from 1914 to 1921, with a large explosion in 1915. The highest point in the Cascades is Mount Rainier, at 4392 m (14,410 ft).\u000a\u000aWest of the Sierra Nevada lies California's Great Valley or "Central Valley", bounded on the west by California's Coast Ranges. The drainage of the west slope of the Sierra Nevada flows into a series of small rivers, which ultimately feed the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River, which meet at the California Delta prior to discharging through San Francisco Bay into the Pacific Ocean. The Great Valley is one of the flattest regions of the United States - 300 km (200 miles) north and south of the delta, which is at sea level, the elevation is on the order of 150 m (500 feet). The Coast Ranges are much lower and more divided than the Sierra Nevada, and form a number of small valleys between ranges; these ranges meet the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific coast is much more rugged than the Atlantic Coast. The coastal ranges of Oregon and Washington are similar to those of California.\u000a\u000aZones of sea-floor spreading create transform faults between them; one of the largest transform faults in the world is California's San Andreas Fault, which starts in Southern California near the Salton Sea and runs to the Mendocino Triple Junction at the borders of the North American Plate, the Juan de Fuca Plate, and the Pacific Plate. The fault runs further inland in Southern California, and closer to the ocean in Northern California; it enters the Pacific Ocean just south of San Francisco, and makes a brief landfall at Point Reyes in Marin County north of San Francisco. The San Andreas Fault generates devastating earthquakes every few hundred years; most recently in 1857 in Southern California and in 1906 in Northern California. Smaller but damaging earthquakes have occurred on the San Andreas Fault and adjacent faults.\u000a\u000aHawaii is a series of tropical volcanic islands; the "Big Island" of Hawaii has two active volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kilauea, with an offshore underwater volcano named Loihi currently active.\u000a\u000aThe state of Alaska consists of a coastal strip west of British Columbia in Canada, and the bulk of the Alaska Peninsula. The coastal strip is characterised by fjords as the coastal mountains meet the Pacific Ocean. The main peninsula consists of a southern coastal plain where most human settlement exists. North of the coastal plain is the Alaska Range, which contains Denali, the highest point in North America at 6194 m (20,320 ft). The Alaska Range continues to the southwest to form the Aleutian Peninsula and ultimately the Aleutian Islands. North of the Alaska Range is Alaska's broad central valley, which is heavily forested, and which primarily drains through the Yukon River into the Bering Sea. Further north, near the Arctic Circle, is the Brooks Range of mountains, which gradually fall to the North Slope of Alaska into the Arctic Ocean.\u000a\u000aThe climate is diverse in the United States, but many parts have a continental climate, often with hot summers and great variations in temperature during a year.\u000a\u000aThe west coast has a maritime climate, with relatively mild winters. There is however a big difference between the northern and southern parts of the west cost. The northern parts receive a lot of precipitation, especially during the fall. The southern and central parts of California have a typical Mediterranean climate, with very little precipitation during late spring, summer, and early fall, and sun most of the year. One of the warmest areas of the world, Death Valley, is located in Southern California.\u000a\u000aEast of the Rocky Mountains are the Great Plains. This area consists of large steppes, having a unique climate. Moist winds from the Gulf of Mexico meet cold wind from the north, which leads to a lot of changing weather. The Great Plains are known for their tornadoes, and for snow and hail storms. The Midwest is known for short springs and falls, and often long winters.\u000a\u000aThe climate is mostly warm in the southern states along the Gulf, and there is rarely snow during the winter. The south often sees hurricanes in the fall, causing great damage.\u000a\u000aThe climate is more varied on the east coast and in the Appalachian Mountains, but a common denominator is that these areas often receive lot of precipitation. The climate of the east coast is to a lesser degree than he west coast affected by the ocean, so that is has a typical continental climate. The northeastern parts of the United States have a lot of snow in the winter, including the coastal areas.\u000a\u000aThe first human settlement of the territory of the United States was that of the Native Americans, migrating south and eastwards from Asia, across a land bridge which connected Alaska to Siberia during a period of glaciation.[3] Native American culture within the territory of the United States had reached the level of small cities in the vicinity of Cahokia and in the Pueblos of the Southwest, and settled agricultural villages in much of the eastern part of the United States. In the Great Plains, the Native Americans were migratory nomads.\u000a\u000aThe first European contact with North America was the settlement of Vinland in the vicinity of Newfoundland by the Vikings, around 1000 AD. Viking explorations may have reached into the territory of the United States, but the settlement failed, and very few records remained. Nearly 500 years later, in 1492, Christopher Columbus, sailing for Spain, reached several islands in the Caribbean Sea. Spanish colonization quickly followed. The first Europeans to reach the North American mainland were the Cabot expedition from Bristol in 1497. Juan Ponce de Leon in 1513 claimed Florida for the Spanish. However, Spanish attempts to colonize Florida were unsuccessful until an expedition in 1565 founded St. Augustine, and drove out a French settlement which had been established nearby the year earlier.\u000a\u000aThe first English settlement in the territory of the United States was the Roanoke Colony, established in 1585, which disappeared around 1590. Throughout this time, English, Dutch, and French fishing vessels began fishing off the coast of New England, and occasionally landing to trade with the native Americans, but the native Americans did not permit settlements. An English colony was established at Jamestown in Virginia in 1607, which became the first permanent English settlement in the United States.\u000a\u000aFurther settlements were made by the English at Plymouth in 1620, by the Dutch at several locations in New Netherlands in 1624 and 1625, and the Swedish at Christiana, Delaware in 1638. Permanent French settlements were established in the territory of Canada in 1599 at Tadoussac and in 1608 at Quebec, but the first permanent French settlements within the boundaries of the United States were not made until 1699 in Louisiana.\u000a\u000aThe English settlements grew faster than the others, and English military action resulted in the passing of the Dutch, Swedish, and French settlements along the Atlantic coast and Canada under British rule.\u000a\u000aTwo million British settlers in 13 colonies (along with German and other immigrants, and African slaves) comprised the Thirteen Colonies of 1775. Angered by deprivation of their historic rights by Britain, they revolted in 1775, and voted to declare independence on July 2, 1776, as the new nation, The United States of America. Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, which expressed the nation's commitment to republican ideals, and was signed on July 4, 1776. The war for independence against Britain, in league with France and others, was a success. George Washington, who led the military effort, chaired the Constitutional Convention of 1787, which divided powers between the states and national government, and divided powers in the latter among legislative (Congress), executive (President) and judicial (Supreme Court) branches.\u000a\u000aThe young nation established the world's first mass political parties in the 1790s. The Democratic party (founded 1828) and the Republican party (founded 1854) have traded control back and forth in the states and nationwide.\u000a\u000aThe country expanded westward, as the frontier shaped the characteristic American traits of expansion, adventure, violence and democracy. The new territories became states (except for Puerto Rico, which is part of the U.S. but is treated separately). The slavery issue led to the American Civil War when the Republican party elected Abraham Lincoln president in 1860 promising to stop the expansion of slavery, and the South seceded and tried to form a new country. The Confederacy was defeated, the union was saved, the slaves all freed and during Reconstruction the slaves were made citizens and voters.\u000a\u000aAfter the war rapid industrialization and urbanization turned the nation into the strongest economic power. Woodrow Wilson used that power to shape the outcome of World War I. The economy crashed in 1929, causing a worldwide depression. Franklin D. Roosevelt met the challenge with New Deal programs of relief, recovery and reform, and built a Democratic party coalition, the New Deal Coalition, comprising unions, ethnics, city machines and the South, that dominated politics until the 1960s, with a commitment to equality. That commitment expanded to include Civil Rights for blacks after 1960.\u000a\u000aThe economy fully recovered in World War II, as Roosevelt made the U.S. the arsenal of democracy in the defeat of Nazi Germany and Japan. The Cold War (1947-1989) was a confrontation between the U.S. and its main allies (western Europe, Japan) on one side and the Soviet Union and its Communist allies on the other. Apart from localized wars in Korea and Vietnam, there were no major conflicts. The U.S. helped split China off from the Soviet Union in the 1970s, opening China up to capitalism and fast economic growth.\u000a\u000aWith victory in the Cold War in 1989, the U.S. became the world's only superpower, but its use of that power in the Middle East remains controversial. The 9-11 attacks by Muslim terrorists opened a "War on Terror". The economy is marked by steady growth, low unemployment and inflation, rapid advances in technology, a large growing super-rich element, and a high rate of immigration (including 12 million illegal immigrants).\u000a\u000aThe United States is a representative democracy, and its structure and system of checks and balances are established by the United States Constitution. The Federal government is divided by the Constitution into three branches - Executive, Judicial and Legislative.\u000a\u000aThere are three main levels of government in the United States, and they are hierarchical, i.e. local governments are subordinate to state governments, but the states are not usually subordinate to the Federal government. The question of the exact relationship is the issue of "federalism"; the main points were settled by the Civil War and Reconstruction, but small points remain a matter of political and constitutional debate.\u000a\u000aThe executive branch is led by the president. The president is responsible for appointing the cabinet, which is confirmed by the Senate. The current head of state and head of government is President Barack Obama, serving a four-year term ending in 2013, and eligible for re-election to one additional term.\u000a\u000aThe judicial branch is headed by the "Highest Court in the Land," the Supreme Court of the United States (nicknamed "SCOTUS"). This court is composed of 9 justices (judges) who are appointed for life by the president. The Supreme Court serves as the last resort for appeals the court itself chooses to hear.\u000a\u000aThe legislative branch of the federal government is composed of the Congress. The Congress is bicameral (two houses), and consists of the House of Representatives and Senate. All states have two senators, and each state's number of representatives is decided by the state's population. The judicial branch consists of a system of federal courts, with the Supreme Court at the top. The Supreme Court has jurisdiction to interpret federal law, determine if laws are incompatible with the U.S. Constitution, determines the legality of decisions made by the Court of Appeals and makes determinations of due process but does not normally make factual determinations or findings of fact.\u000a\u000aThe economy of the United States is based upon capitalism, with elements of a mixed economy. The U.S. is the world's economical powerhouse, and the standard of living is mostly high. The median income is $46,326 per household. The wealth is somewhat unevenly distributed; the top 20% have a household median income of $91,705, the lowest 20% have $19,178.\u000a\u000aPrivate enterprises account for the biggest part of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product, but the public sector is also substantial, consisting of 35% of the GDP. Government regulations are not as extensive as in many other western countries. The labor market is flexible, and social welfare services are more limited than in Europe. Social spending is increasing, and the cost of federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid is growing.\u000a\u000aThe central bank of the United States is the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve is independent from the government, and Congress does not interfere with its policies.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. is a major exporter of agricultural products. American agriculture is highly mechanized, and only 834,000 workers are employed in the sector.[4] This has changed significantly over time; in 1870 half of the U.S. population was employed in agriculture.\u000a\u000aWheat, corn and soybeans are grown on in the Midwest. Soybeans and cotton are important in the South, but tobacco is being phased out after 400 years in Virginia (as well as North Carolina and Kentucky). California is the most important farm state, with a very large variety of crops and vegetables, with grapes for wine a specialty. Florida was historically a major citrus state, but its orange groves are becoming housing tracts. Dairy farming is important in several areas, especially California, Wisconsin and Vermont. Cattle, poultry, and hogs comprise the large livestock industry. Thanks to federal subsidies, a large and growing portion of corn is used to make ethanol.\u000a\u000aThe United States is rich on natural resources, and has for example gold, silver, petroleum, coal, iron, and uranium. The domestic supply of some natural resources is not sufficient, and the U.S. is the world's largest importer of oil, despite being one of the world's larger producers of oil. America has large supplies of coal, mostly in Wyoming, and West Virginia.\u000a\u000aAmerica has been one of the leading industrial nations in the world since the late 19th century. Manufacturing is accounting for a large part of the GDP, but the traditional heavy industries of the northeast have been in decline recently. The former Manufacturing Belt is now nicknamed the Rust Belt.\u000a\u000aThe automobile industry has long traditions in the United States. Henry Ford pioneered the use of assembly lines, and founded the Ford Motor Company. Michigan, specifically Detroit, became the home to the largest manufacturers, dubbed the "Big Three" (General Motors, Ford, Chrysler). The Big Three are now shrinking, as consumers move toward smaller, more fuel-efficient Japanese models built in the U.S by Toyota, Honda, and Nissan.\u000a\u000aToday, much of the United States is employed in the service industries, and in the knowledge economy.\u000a\u000aThe population of the United States reached 300 million in 2006. The population is heterogeneous, and consists of many ethnic groups. The majority of Americans are of primarily European descent. The most common ethnic backgrounds are English, Irish, and German. African-Americans, mostly descended from slaves brought from Africa in the 1700s, were recently displaced as the largest minority group by Hispanics, who arrived from Mexico and other Latin American nations.\u000a\u000aEnglish is the de facto national language, even though there is no official language at the federal level. Applicants for U.S. citizenship have to pass an English literacy test. About 82% of the population speak nothing but English at home; the second most common language is Spanish, but languages from Asia and the Middle East are also well-represented.[5] 29 states have made English their official language; some consider this to be a response to the identification of languages other than English as symptomatic of a threat to 'American values.'[6]\u000a\u000aTwo of the U.S.A.'s fifty states are officially bilingual: New Mexico (with Spanish) and Hawaii (with Hawaiian). Louisiana law also grants French some recognition. The U.S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico had Spanish as the sole official language from 1991; a 1993 law restored English to the same status.[7]\u000a\u000aTransportation in the United States is highly dependent on the automobile and airplane. Automobile use exceeds that of other industralized countries, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan. [8] Large cities usually have public transportation, with buses the workhorse and light rail growing in popularity. Passenger rail travel has rapidly faded away, with only limited service provided by Amtrak, a government owned company. Intercity buses, such as Greyhound, serve a downscale clientele that lacks access to an automobile.[9]\u000a\u000aAir service is extensive, with a dense network comprising major carriers and numerous regional carriers, The industry has been financially troubled since the 9-11 Attack, but prices keep falling. Most airlines use a hub-and-spoke configuration with the main hubs at Chicago, Atlanta and Dallas. Airline deregulation occurred in 1978 ending the necessity for government approval of air fares and air routes within the United States. [10] The United States does not have a state owned flag carrier. The largest airlines include American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Continental Airlines, US Airways, Southwest Airlines, and Alaska Airlines.\u000a\u000aIn 1956, the federal government began systematic building of high speed superhighways linking all major cities and most minor ones. This "Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways" (called the Interstate Highway System), now composes 46,837 miles (75,360 km) of highway. [11]\u000a\u000aChurch and State are separated federally by the First Amendment, extended to the states by the Fourteenth; no government aid is allowed to religion or religious schools, although the exact line is controversial. Religion is an integral part of daily life for most Americans, and society is not as secularized as in many other developed nations. Six out of ten Americans feel that their faith plays a very important role in their lives.[12] American freedom of religion was initially tried in Rhode Island which, unlike the more Puritan New England states, allowed a great diversity of religious practice, to the point where it was referred to by many as "Rogue Island". The First Amendment has roots in Thomas Jefferson's Virginia Statutes for Religious Freedom, written in 1779, to make it so that "no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever" and to ensure "that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinion in matters of religion".\u000a\u000aAbout 90% of Americans are believers. Christianity is the largest religion, divided about equally among mainline Protestants, evangelical Protestants, and Roman Catholics. The United States has led to the founding of a number of new religious movements, some reaching the point of being recognized as world religions: Mary Baker Eddy claimed to have discover a specifically Christian "mind cure" which she established as the Church of Jesus Christ, Scientist - better known as the Christian Science movement - whose central church is in Boston, Massachusetts. New York state resident Joseph Smith claimed to have found a set of gold plates placed which contained a follow-on volume to the New Testament detailing how Jesus travelled to America. This became the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints - popularly known as Mormonism - which now has a global following, and is based in Salt Lake City, Utah. Other religious movements founded in the United States include the Jehovah's Witnesses movement, the Unitarian Universalist Association and the Church of Scientology.\u000a\u000aReligion is an important part of American politics, and the personal beliefs of candidates are often used in political campaigns. All presidents of the United States have had a Protestant background, with the exception of John F. Kennedy who was Catholic.\u000a\u000aWhile the United States is often thought of as a place that bears an antipathy to intellectualism and abstract thought, it has been the home of many great writers, scientists, philosophers, academics and others engaged in the life of the mind. The poetry and philosophy of Transcendentalism combined the philosophy of Immanuel Kant and German idealism with Romanticism and the Vedic philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita. Transcendentalism can be seen in the work of Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and in the community founded by Bronson Alcott. The writings and ideas of the Transcendentalists have influenced American thought ever since.\u000a\u000aA more recent American philosophical movement of note is that of pragmatism, the basing of truth on practical consequences. Charles Sanders Peirce is widely considered to be the originator of this philosophy, which was then developed in the writings of William James and John Dewey. As an example, James, a professor at Harvard, produced a series of Gifford Lectures on the varieties of religious experience, which looked at religion not from the truth value of the beliefs or the philosophical and theological considerations that go into believing them, but the psychological status of those beliefs - the benefits and drawbacks of different religious beliefs, and how they fit into the lives of adherents. A religious belief then may be true or false in the sense of corresponding to the facts, but, for the pragmatists, the practical consequences of the belief must be taken into account when determining the truth of the idea.\u000a\u000aThe anti-intellectual streak in American history was written about in depth by the historian Richard Hofstadter in Anti-intellectualism in American Life, where he stated that the causes of American anti-intellectualism stem from a business-minded utilitarian ethic, a self-reliant distrust of elites and a strident Protestant evangelical movement. During the 2008 Presidential campaign, Obama's background as a law professor and as an intellectual caused many to suggest that it would make him out-of-touch[13], although many celebrated a change in style from President Bush's "folksy" persona.

VMetabolism (from Greek: \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae metabol\u0113, "change") is the set of life-sustaining chemical transformations within the cells of living organisms. These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. The word metabolism can also refer to all chemical reactions that occur in living organisms, including digestion and the transport of substances into and between different cells, in which case the set of reactions within the cells is called intermediary metabolism or intermediate metabolism.\u000a\u000aMetabolism is usually divided into two categories. Catabolism, that breaks down organic matter and harvests energy by way of cellular respiration, and anabolism that uses energy to construct components of cells such as proteins and nucleic acids.\u000a\u000aThe chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical, by a sequence of enzymes. Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require energy that will not occur by themselves, by coupling them to spontaneous reactions that release energy. Enzymes act as catalysts that allow the reactions to proceed more rapidly. Enzymes also allow the regulation of metabolic pathways in response to changes in the cell's environment or to signals from other cells.\u000a\u000aThe metabolic system of a particular organism determines which substances it will find nutritious and which poisonous. For example, some prokaryotes use hydrogen sulfide as a nutrient, yet this gas is poisonous to animals.[1] The speed of metabolism, the metabolic rate, influences how much food an organism will require, and also affects how it is able to obtain that food.\u000a\u000aA striking feature of metabolism is the similarity of the basic metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species.[2] For example, the set of carboxylic acids that are best known as the intermediates in the citric acid cycle are present in all known organisms, being found in species as diverse as the unicellular bacterium Escherichia coli and huge multicellular organisms like elephants.[3] These striking similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in evolutionary history, and retained because of their efficacy.[4][5]\u000a\u000aMost of the structures that make up animals, plants and microbes are made from three basic classes of molecule: amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids (often called fats). As these molecules are vital for life, metabolic reactions either focus on making these molecules during the construction of cells and tissues, or by breaking them down and using them as a source of energy, by their digestion. These biochemicals can be joined together to make polymers such as DNA and proteins, essential macromolecules of life.\u000a\u000aProteins are made of amino acids arranged in a linear chain joined together by peptide bonds. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyze the chemical reactions in metabolism. Other proteins have structural or mechanical functions, such as those that form the cytoskeleton, a system of scaffolding that maintains the cell shape.[6] Proteins are also important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, active transport across membranes, and the cell cycle.[7] Amino acids also contribute to cellular energy metabolism by providing a carbon source for entry into the citric acid cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle),[8] especially when a primary source of energy, such as glucose, is scarce, or when cells undergo metabolic stress.[9]\u000a\u000aLipids are the most diverse group of biochemicals. Their main structural uses are as part of biological membranes both internal and external, such as the cell membrane, or as a source of energy.[7] Lipids are usually defined as hydrophobic or amphipathic biological molecules but will dissolve in organic solvents such as benzene or chloroform.[10] The fats are a large group of compounds that contain fatty acids and glycerol; a glycerol molecule attached to three fatty acid esters is called a triacylglyceride.[11] Several variations on this basic structure exist, including alternate backbones such as sphingosine in the sphingolipids, and hydrophilic groups such as phosphate as in phospholipids. Steroids such as cholesterol are another major class of lipids.[12]\u000a\u000aCarbohydrates are aldehydes or ketones, with many hydroxyl groups attached, that can exist as straight chains or rings. Carbohydrates are the most abundant biological molecules, and fill numerous roles, such as the storage and transport of energy (starch, glycogen) and structural components (cellulose in plants, chitin in animals).[7] The basic carbohydrate units are called monosaccharides and include galactose, fructose, and most importantly glucose. Monosaccharides can be linked together to form polysaccharides in almost limitless ways.[13]\u000a\u000aThe two nucleic acids, DNA and RNA are polymers of nucleotides, each nucleotide composed of a phosphate group, a ribose sugar group, and a nitrogenous base. Nucleic acids are critical for the storage and use of genetic information, and its interpretation through the processes of transcription and protein biosynthesis.[7] This information is protected by DNA repair mechanisms and propagated through DNA replication. Many viruses have an RNA genome, for example HIV, which uses reverse transcription to create a DNA template from its viral RNA genome.[14] RNA in ribozymes such as spliceosomes and ribosomes is similar to enzymes as it can catalyze chemical reactions. Individual nucleosides are made by attaching a nucleobase to a ribose sugar. These bases are heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen, classified as purines or pyrimidines. Nucleotides also act as coenzymes in metabolic group transfer reactions.[15]\u000a\u000aMetabolism involves a vast array of chemical reactions, but most fall under a few basic types of reactions that involve the transfer of functional groups.[16] This common chemistry allows cells to use a small set of metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different reactions.[15] These group-transfer intermediates are called coenzymes. Each class of group-transfer reactions is carried out by a particular coenzyme, which is the substrate for a set of enzymes that produce it, and a set of enzymes that consume it. These coenzymes are therefore continuously made, consumed and then recycled.[17]\u000a\u000aOne central coenzyme is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the universal energy currency of cells. This nucleotide is used to transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions. There is only a small amount of ATP in cells, but as it is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day.[17] ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism, with catabolic reactions generating ATP and anabolic reactions consuming it. It also serves as a carrier of phosphate groups in phosphorylation reactions.\u000a\u000aA vitamin is an organic compound needed in small quantities that cannot be made in cells. In human nutrition, most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification; for example, all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated or are coupled to nucleotides when they are used in cells.[18] Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a derivative of vitamin B (niacin), is an important coenzyme that acts as a hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of separate types of dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD+ into NADH. This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate for any of the reductases in the cell that need to reduce their substrates.[19] Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two related forms in the cell, NADH and NADPH. The NAD+/NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions, while NADP+/NADPH is used in anabolic reactions.\u000a\u000aInorganic elements play critical roles in metabolism; some are abundant (e.g. sodium and potassium) while others function at minute concentrations. About 99% of a mammal's mass is made up of the elements carbon, nitrogen, calcium, sodium, chlorine, potassium, hydrogen, phosphorus, oxygen and sulfur.[20] Organic compounds (proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) contain the majority of the carbon and nitrogen; most of the oxygen and hydrogen is present as water.[20]\u000a\u000aThe abundant inorganic elements act as ionic electrolytes. The most important ions are sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, phosphate and the organic ion bicarbonate. The maintenance of precise ion gradients across cell membranes maintains osmotic pressure and pH.[21] Ions are also critical for nerve and muscle function, as action potentials in these tissues are produced by the exchange of electrolytes between the extracellular fluid and the cell's fluid, the cytosol.[22] Electrolytes enter and leave cells through proteins in the cell membrane called ion channels. For example, muscle contraction depends upon the movement of calcium, sodium and potassium through ion channels in the cell membrane and T-tubules.[23]\u000a\u000aTransition metals are usually present as trace elements in organisms, with zinc and iron being most abundant of those.[24][25] These metals are used in some proteins as cofactors and are essential for the activity of enzymes such as catalase and oxygen-carrier proteins such as hemoglobin.[26] Metal cofactors are bound tightly to specific sites in proteins; although enzyme cofactors can be modified during catalysis, they always return to their original state by the end of the reaction catalyzed. Metal micronutrients are taken up into organisms by specific transporters and bind to storage proteins such as ferritin or metallothionein when not in use.[27][28]\u000a\u000aCatabolism is the set of metabolic processes that break down large molecules. These include breaking down and oxidizing food molecules. The purpose of the catabolic reactions is to provide the energy and components needed by anabolic reactions. The exact nature of these catabolic reactions differ from organism to organism and organisms can be classified based on their sources of energy and carbon (their primary nutritional groups), as shown in the table below. Organic molecules are used as a source of energy by organotrophs, while lithotrophs use inorganic substrates and phototrophs capture sunlight as chemical energy. However, all these different forms of metabolism depend on redox reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from reduced donor molecules such as organic molecules, water, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide or ferrous ions to acceptor molecules such as oxygen, nitrate or sulfate.[29] In animals these reactions involve complex organic molecules that are broken down to simpler molecules, such as carbon dioxide and water. In photosynthetic organisms such as plants and cyanobacteria, these electron-transfer reactions do not release energy, but are used as a way of storing energy absorbed from sunlight.[7]\u000a\u000aThe most common set of catabolic reactions in animals can be separated into three main stages. In the first, large organic molecules such as proteins, polysaccharides or lipids are digested into their smaller components outside cells. Next, these smaller molecules are taken up by cells and converted to yet smaller molecules, usually acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which releases some energy. Finally, the acetyl group on the CoA is oxidised to water and carbon dioxide in the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain, releasing the energy that is stored by reducing the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) into NADH.\u000a\u000aMacromolecules such as starch, cellulose or proteins cannot be rapidly taken up by cells and must be broken into their smaller units before they can be used in cell metabolism. Several common classes of enzymes digest these polymers. These digestive enzymes include proteases that digest proteins into amino acids, as well as glycoside hydrolases that digest polysaccharides into simple sugars known as monosaccharides.\u000a\u000aMicrobes simply secrete digestive enzymes into their surroundings,[30][31] while animals only secrete these enzymes from specialized cells in their guts.[32] The amino acids or sugars released by these extracellular enzymes are then pumped into cells by active transport proteins.[33][34]\u000a\u000aCarbohydrate catabolism is the breakdown of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharides.[35] Once inside, the major route of breakdown is glycolysis, where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some ATP is generated.[36] Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA and fed into the citric acid cycle. Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD+ as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces lactate, through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway, which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as ribose, the sugar component of nucleic acids.\u000a\u000aFats are catabolised by hydrolysis to free fatty acids and glycerol. The glycerol enters glycolysis and the fatty acids are broken down by beta oxidation to release acetyl-CoA, which then is fed into the citric acid cycle. Fatty acids release more energy upon oxidation than carbohydrates because carbohydrates contain more oxygen in their structures.\u000a\u000aAmino acids are either used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules, or oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide as a source of energy.[37] The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase. The amino group is fed into the urea cycle, leaving a deaminated carbon skeleton in the form of a keto acid. Several of these keto acids are intermediates in the citric acid cycle, for example the deamination of glutamate forms \u03b1-ketoglutarate.[38] The glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis (discussed below).[39]\u000a\u000aIn oxidative phosphorylation, the electrons removed from organic molecules in areas such as the protagon acid cycle are transferred to oxygen and the energy released is used to make ATP. This is done in eukaryotes by a series of proteins in the membranes of mitochondria called the electron transport chain. In prokaryotes, these proteins are found in the cell's inner membrane.[40] These proteins use the energy released from passing electrons from reduced molecules like NADH onto oxygen to pump protons across a membrane.[41]\u000a\u000aPumping protons out of the mitochondria creates a proton concentration difference across the membrane and generates an electrochemical gradient.[42] This force drives protons back into the mitochondrion through the base of an enzyme called ATP synthase. The flow of protons makes the stalk subunit rotate, causing the active site of the synthase domain to change shape and phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate \u2013 turning it into ATP.[17]\u000a\u000aChemolithotrophy is a type of metabolism found in prokaryotes where energy is obtained from the oxidation of inorganic compounds. These organisms can use hydrogen,[43] reduced sulfur compounds (such as sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and thiosulfate),[1] ferrous iron (FeII)[44] or ammonia[45] as sources of reducing power and they gain energy from the oxidation of these compounds with electron acceptors such as oxygen or nitrite.[46] These microbial processes are important in global biogeochemical cycles such as acetogenesis, nitrification and denitrification and are critical for soil fertility.[47][48]\u000a\u000aThe energy in sunlight is captured by plants, cyanobacteria, purple bacteria, green sulfur bacteria and some protists. This process is often coupled to the conversion of carbon dioxide into organic compounds, as part of photosynthesis, which is discussed below. The energy capture and carbon fixation systems can however operate separately in prokaryotes, as purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria can use sunlight as a source of energy, while switching between carbon fixation and the fermentation of organic compounds.[49][50]\u000a\u000aIn many organisms the capture of solar energy is similar in principle to oxidative phosphorylation, as it involves the storage of energy as a proton concentration gradient. This proton motive force then drives ATP synthesis.[17] The electrons needed to drive this electron transport chain come from light-gathering proteins called photosynthetic reaction centres or rhodopsins. Reaction centers are classed into two types depending on the type of photosynthetic pigment present, with most photosynthetic bacteria only having one type, while plants and cyanobacteria have two.[51]\u000a\u000aIn plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosystem II uses light energy to remove electrons from water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. The electrons then flow to the cytochrome b6f complex, which uses their energy to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane in the chloroplast.[7] These protons move back through the membrane as they drive the ATP synthase, as before. The electrons then flow through photosystem I and can then either be used to reduce the coenzyme NADP+, for use in the Calvin cycle, which is discussed below, or recycled for further ATP generation.[52]\u000a\u000aAnabolism is the set of constructive metabolic processes where the energy released by catabolism is used to synthesize complex molecules. In general, the complex molecules that make up cellular structures are constructed step-by-step from small and simple precursors. Anabolism involves three basic stages. Firstly, the production of precursors such as amino acids, monosaccharides, isoprenoids and nucleotides, secondly, their activation into reactive forms using energy from ATP, and thirdly, the assembly of these precursors into complex molecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and nucleic acids.\u000a\u000aOrganisms differ in how many of the molecules in their cells they can construct for themselves. Autotrophs such as plants can construct the complex organic molecules in cells such as polysaccharides and proteins from simple molecules like carbon dioxide and water. Heterotrophs, on the other hand, require a source of more complex substances, such as monosaccharides and amino acids, to produce these complex molecules. Organisms can be further classified by ultimate source of their energy: photoautotrophs and photoheterotrophs obtain energy from light, whereas chemoautotrophs and chemoheterotrophs obtain energy from inorganic oxidation reactions.\u000a\u000aPhotosynthesis is the synthesis of carbohydrates from sunlight and carbon dioxide (CO ). In plants, cyanobacteria and algae, oxygenic photosynthesis splits water, with oxygen produced as a waste product. This process uses the ATP and NADPH produced by the photosynthetic reaction centres, as described above, to convert CO into glycerate 3-phosphate, which can then be converted into glucose. This carbon-fixation reaction is carried out by the enzyme RuBisCO as part of the Calvin \u2013 Benson cycle.[53] Three types of photosynthesis occur in plants, C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation and CAM photosynthesis. These differ by the route that carbon dioxide takes to the Calvin cycle, with C3 plants fixing CO directly, while C4 and CAM photosynthesis incorporate the CO into other compounds first, as adaptations to deal with intense sunlight and dry conditions.[54]\u000a\u000aIn photosynthetic prokaryotes the mechanisms of carbon fixation are more diverse. Here, carbon dioxide can be fixed by the Calvin \u2013 Benson cycle, a reversed citric acid cycle,[55] or the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA.[56][57] Prokaryotic chemoautotrophs also fix CO through the Calvin \u2013 Benson cycle, but use energy from inorganic compounds to drive the reaction.[58]\u000a\u000aIn carbohydrate anabolism, simple organic acids can be converted into monosaccharides such as glucose and then used to assemble polysaccharides such as starch. The generation of glucose from compounds like pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, glycerate 3-phosphate and amino acids is called gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis converts pyruvate to glucose-6-phosphate through a series of intermediates, many of which are shared with glycolysis.[36] However, this pathway is not simply glycolysis run in reverse, as several steps are catalyzed by non-glycolytic enzymes. This is important as it allows the formation and breakdown of glucose to be regulated separately, and prevents both pathways from running simultaneously in a futile cycle.[59][60]\u000a\u000aAlthough fat is a common way of storing energy, in vertebrates such as humans the fatty acids in these stores cannot be converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis as these organisms cannot convert acetyl-CoA into pyruvate; plants do, but animals do not, have the necessary enzymatic machinery.[61] As a result, after long-term starvation, vertebrates need to produce ketone bodies from fatty acids to replace glucose in tissues such as the brain that cannot metabolize fatty acids.[62] In other organisms such as plants and bacteria, this metabolic problem is solved using the glyoxylate cycle, which bypasses the decarboxylation step in the citric acid cycle and allows the transformation of acetyl-CoA to oxaloacetate, where it can be used for the production of glucose.[61][63]\u000a\u000aPolysaccharides and glycans are made by the sequential addition of monosaccharides by glycosyltransferase from a reactive sugar-phosphate donor such as uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-glucose) to an acceptor hydroxyl group on the growing polysaccharide. As any of the hydroxyl groups on the ring of the substrate can be acceptors, the polysaccharides produced can have straight or branched structures.[64] The polysaccharides produced can have structural or metabolic functions themselves, or be transferred to lipids and proteins by enzymes called oligosaccharyltransferases.[65][66]\u000a\u000aFatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups, in animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional type I protein,[67] while in plant plastids and bacteria separate type II enzymes perform each step in the pathway.[68][69]\u000a\u000aTerpenes and isoprenoids are a large class of lipids that include the carotenoids and form the largest class of plant natural products.[70] These compounds are made by the assembly and modification of isoprene units donated from the reactive precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate.[71] These precursors can be made in different ways. In animals and archaea, the mevalonate pathway produces these compounds from acetyl-CoA,[72] while in plants and bacteria the non-mevalonate pathway uses pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrates.[71][73] One important reaction that uses these activated isoprene donors is steroid biosynthesis. Here, the isoprene units are joined together to make squalene and then folded up and formed into a set of rings to make lanosterol.[74] Lanosterol can then be converted into other steroids such as cholesterol and ergosterol.[74][75]\u000a\u000aOrganisms vary in their ability to synthesize the 20 common amino acids. Most bacteria and plants can synthesize all twenty, but mammals can only synthesize eleven nonessential amino acids, so nine essential amino acids must be obtained from food.[7] Some simple parasites, such as the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae, lack all amino acid synthesis and take their amino acids directly from their hosts.[76] All amino acids are synthesized from intermediates in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or the pentose phosphate pathway. Nitrogen is provided by glutamate and glutamine. Amino acid synthesis depends on the formation of the appropriate alpha-keto acid, which is then transaminated to form an amino acid.[77]\u000a\u000aAmino acids are made into proteins by being joined together in a chain of peptide bonds. Each different protein has a unique sequence of amino acid residues: this is its primary structure. Just as the letters of the alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, amino acids can be linked in varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins. Proteins are made from amino acids that have been activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA precursor is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase.[78] This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which joins the amino acid onto the elongating protein chain, using the sequence information in a messenger RNA.[79]\u000a\u000aNucleotides are made from amino acids, carbon dioxide and formic acid in pathways that require large amounts of metabolic energy.[80] Consequently, most organisms have efficient systems to salvage preformed nucleotides.[80][81] Purines are synthesized as nucleosides (bases attached to ribose). [82] Both adenine and guanine are made from the precursor nucleoside inosine monophosphate, which is synthesized using atoms from the amino acids glycine, glutamine, and aspartic acid, as well as formate transferred from the coenzyme tetrahydrofolate. Pyrimidines, on the other hand, are synthesized from the base orotate, which is formed from glutamine and aspartate.[83]\u000a\u000aAll organisms are constantly exposed to compounds that they cannot use as foods and would be harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function. These potentially damaging compounds are called xenobiotics.[84] Xenobiotics such as synthetic drugs, natural poisons and antibiotics are detoxified by a set of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. In humans, these include cytochrome P450 oxidases,[85] UDP-glucuronosyltransferases,[86] and glutathione S-transferases.[87] This system of enzymes acts in three stages to firstly oxidize the xenobiotic (phase I) and then conjugate water-soluble groups onto the molecule (phase II). The modified water-soluble xenobiotic can then be pumped out of cells and in multicellular organisms may be further metabolized before being excreted (phase III). In ecology, these reactions are particularly important in microbial biodegradation of pollutants and the bioremediation of contaminated land and oil spills.[88] Many of these microbial reactions are shared with multicellular organisms, but due to the incredible diversity of types of microbes these organisms are able to deal with a far wider range of xenobiotics than multicellular organisms, and can degrade even persistent organic pollutants such as organochloride compounds.[89]\u000a\u000aA related problem for aerobic organisms is oxidative stress.[90] Here, processes including oxidative phosphorylation and the formation of disulfide bonds during protein folding produce reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide.[91] These damaging oxidants are removed by antioxidant metabolites such as glutathione and enzymes such as catalases and peroxidases.[92][93]\u000a\u000aLiving organisms must obey the laws of thermodynamics, which describe the transfer of heat and work. The second law of thermodynamics states that in any closed system, the amount of entropy (disorder) will tend to increase. Although living organisms' amazing complexity appears to contradict this law, life is possible as all organisms are open systems that exchange matter and energy with their surroundings. Thus living systems are not in equilibrium, but instead are dissipative systems that maintain their state of high complexity by causing a larger increase in the entropy of their environments.[94] The metabolism of a cell achieves this by coupling the spontaneous processes of catabolism to the non-spontaneous processes of anabolism. In thermodynamic terms, metabolism maintains order by creating disorder.[95]\u000a\u000aAs the environments of most organisms are constantly changing, the reactions of metabolism must be finely regulated to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called homeostasis.[96][97] Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments.[98] Two closely linked concepts are important for understanding how metabolic pathways are controlled. Firstly, the regulation of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the control exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the flux through the pathway).[99] For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity (i.e. it is highly regulated) but if these changes have little effect on the flux of a metabolic pathway, then this enzyme is not involved in the control of the pathway.[100]\u000a\u000aThere are multiple levels of metabolic regulation. In intrinsic regulation, the metabolic pathway self-regulates to respond to changes in the levels of substrates or products; for example, a decrease in the amount of product can increase the flux through the pathway to compensate.[99] This type of regulation often involves allosteric regulation of the activities of multiple enzymes in the pathway.[101] Extrinsic control involves a cell in a multicellular organism changing its metabolism in response to signals from other cells. These signals are usually in the form of soluble messengers such as hormones and growth factors and are detected by specific receptors on the cell surface.[102] These signals are then transmitted inside the cell by second messenger systems that often involved the phosphorylation of proteins.[103]\u000a\u000aA very well understood example of extrinsic control is the regulation of glucose metabolism by the hormone insulin.[104] Insulin is produced in response to rises in blood glucose levels. Binding of the hormone to insulin receptors on cells then activates a cascade of protein kinases that cause the cells to take up glucose and convert it into storage molecules such as fatty acids and glycogen.[105] The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by activity of phosphorylase, the enzyme that breaks down glycogen, and glycogen synthase, the enzyme that makes it. These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion, with phosphorylation inhibiting glycogen synthase, but activating phosphorylase. Insulin causes glycogen synthesis by activating protein phosphatases and producing a decrease in the phosphorylation of these enzymes.[106]\u000a\u000aThe central pathways of metabolism described above, such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, are present in all three domains of living things and were present in the last universal ancestor.[3][107] This universal ancestral cell was prokaryotic and probably a methanogen that had extensive amino acid, nucleotide, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.[108][109] The retention of these ancient pathways during later evolution may be the result of these reactions having been an optimal solution to their particular metabolic problems, with pathways such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle producing their end products highly efficiently and in a minimal number of steps.[4][5] Mutation changes that affect non-coding DNA segments may merely affect the metabolic efficiency of the individual for whom the mutation occurs.[110] The first pathways of enzyme-based metabolism may have been parts of purine nucleotide metabolism, while previous metabolic pathways were a part of the ancient RNA world.[111]\u000a\u000aMany models have been proposed to describe the mechanisms by which novel metabolic pathways evolve. These include the sequential addition of novel enzymes to a short ancestral pathway, the duplication and then divergence of entire pathways as well as the recruitment of pre-existing enzymes and their assembly into a novel reaction pathway.[112] The relative importance of these mechanisms is unclear, but genomic studies have shown that enzymes in a pathway are likely to have a shared ancestry, suggesting that many pathways have evolved in a step-by-step fashion with novel functions created from pre-existing steps in the pathway.[113] An alternative model comes from studies that trace the evolution of proteins' structures in metabolic networks, this has suggested that enzymes are pervasively recruited, borrowing enzymes to perform similar functions in different metabolic pathways (evident in the MANET database)[114] These recruitment processes result in an evolutionary enzymatic mosaic.[115] A third possibility is that some parts of metabolism might exist as "modules" that can be reused in different pathways and perform similar functions on different molecules.[116]\u000a\u000aAs well as the evolution of new metabolic pathways, evolution can also cause the loss of metabolic functions. For example, in some parasites metabolic processes that are not essential for survival are lost and preformed amino acids, nucleotides and carbohydrates may instead be scavenged from the host.[117] Similar reduced metabolic capabilities are seen in endosymbiotic organisms.[118]\u000a\u000aClassically, metabolism is studied by a reductionist approach that focuses on a single metabolic pathway. Particularly valuable is the use of radioactive tracers at the whole-organism, tissue and cellular levels, which define the paths from precursors to final products by identifying radioactively labelled intermediates and products.[119] The enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then be purified and their kinetics and responses to inhibitors investigated. A parallel approach is to identify the small molecules in a cell or tissue; the complete set of these molecules is called the metabolome. Overall, these studies give a good view of the structure and function of simple metabolic pathways, but are inadequate when applied to more complex systems such as the metabolism of a complete cell.[120]\u000a\u000aAn idea of the complexity of the metabolic networks in cells that contain thousands of different enzymes is given by the figure showing the interactions between just 43 proteins and 40 metabolites to the right: the sequences of genomes provide lists containing anything up to 45,000 genes.[121] However, it is now possible to use this genomic data to reconstruct complete networks of biochemical reactions and produce more holistic mathematical models that may explain and predict their behavior.[122] These models are especially powerful when used to integrate the pathway and metabolite data obtained through classical methods with data on gene expression from proteomic and DNA microarray studies.[123] Using these techniques, a model of human metabolism has now been produced, which will guide future drug discovery and biochemical research.[124] These models are now used in network analysis, to classify human diseases into groups that share common proteins or metabolites.[125][126]\u000a\u000aBacterial metabolic networks are a striking example of bow-tie[127][128][129] organization, an architecture able to input a wide range of nutrients and produce a large variety of products and complex macromolecules using a relatively few intermediate common currencies.\u000a\u000aA major technological application of this information is metabolic engineering. Here, organisms such as yeast, plants or bacteria are genetically modified to make them more useful in biotechnology and aid the production of drugs such as antibiotics or industrial chemicals such as 1,3-propanediol and shikimic acid.[130] These genetic modifications usually aim to reduce the amount of energy used to produce the product, increase yields and reduce the production of wastes.[131]\u000a\u000aThe term metabolism is derived from the Greek \u039c\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u2013 "Metabolismos" for "change", or "overthrow".[132] The history of the scientific study of metabolism spans several centuries and has moved from examining whole animals in early studies, to examining individual metabolic reactions in modern biochemistry. The first controlled experiments in human metabolism were published by Santorio Santorio in 1614 in his book Ars de statica medicina.[133] He described how he weighed himself before and after eating, sleep, working, sex, fasting, drinking, and excreting. He found that most of the food he took in was lost through what he called "insensible perspiration".\u000a\u000aIn these early studies, the mechanisms of these metabolic processes had not been identified and a vital force was thought to animate living tissue.[134] In the 19th century, when studying the fermentation of sugar to alcohol by yeast, Louis Pasteur concluded that fermentation was catalyzed by substances within the yeast cells he called "ferments". He wrote that "alcoholic fermentation is an act correlated with the life and organization of the yeast cells, not with the death or putrefaction of the cells."[135] This discovery, along with the publication by Friedrich Wöhler in 1828 of a paper on the chemical synthesis of urea,[136] and is notable for being the first organic compound prepared from wholly inorganic precursors. This proved that the organic compounds and chemical reactions found in cells were no different in principle than any other part of chemistry.\u000a\u000aIt was the discovery of enzymes at the beginning of the 20th century by Eduard Buchner that separated the study of the chemical reactions of metabolism from the biological study of cells, and marked the beginnings of biochemistry.[137] The mass of biochemical knowledge grew rapidly throughout the early 20th century. One of the most prolific of these modern biochemists was Hans Krebs who made huge contributions to the study of metabolism.[138] He discovered the urea cycle and later, working with Hans Kornberg, the citric acid cycle and the glyoxylate cycle.[139][63] Modern biochemical research has been greatly aided by the development of new techniques such as chromatography, X-ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, radioisotopic labelling, electron microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. These techniques have allowed the discovery and detailed analysis of the many molecules and metabolic pathways in cells.

Vdog (Canis lupus familiaris), domestic mammal of the family Canidae (order Carnivora). It is a subspecies of the gray wolf (C. lupus) and is related to foxes and jackals. The dog is one of the two most ubiquitous and popular domestic animals in the world (the cat is the other). For more than 12,000 years it has lived with humans as a hunting companion, protector, object of scorn or adoration, and friend.\u000a\u000aThe dog evolved from the gray wolf into more than 400 distinct breeds. Human beings have played a major role in creating dogs that fulfill distinct societal needs. Through the most rudimentary form of genetic engineering, dogs were bred to accentuate instincts that were evident from their earliest encounters with humans. Although details about the evolution of dogs are uncertain, the first dogs were hunters with keen senses of sight and smell. Humans developed these instincts and created new breeds as need or desire arose.\u000a\u000aDogs are regarded differently in different parts of the world. Characteristics of loyalty, friendship, protectiveness, and affection have earned dogs an important position in Western society, and in the United States and Europe the care and feeding of dogs has become a multibillion-dollar business. Western civilization has given the relationship between human and dog great importance, but, in some of the developing nations and in many areas of Asia, dogs are not held in the same esteem. In some areas of the world, dogs are used as guards or beasts of burden or even for food, whereas in the United States and Europe dogs are protected and admired. In ancient Egypt during the days of the pharaohs, dogs were considered to be sacred.\u000a\u000aDogs have played an important role in the history of human civilization and were among the first domesticated animals. They were important in hunter-gatherer societies as hunting allies and bodyguards against predators. When livestock were domesticated about 7,000 to 9,000 years ago, dogs served as herders and guardians of sheep, goats, and cattle. Although many still serve in these capacities, dogs are increasingly used for social purposes and companionship. Today dogs are employed as guides for the blind and disabled or for police work. Dogs are even used in therapy in nursing homes and hospitals to encourage patients toward recovery. Humans have bred a wide range of different dogs adapted to serve a variety of functions. This has been enhanced by improvements in veterinary care and animal husbandry.

VDogs are domesticated canines that have been closely associated with humans ever since they first evolved from gray wolves several thousand years ago. Throughout the world dogs are still intimately associated with humans in a variety of roles, and because of this they are often called "man's best friend". Today they are nearly ubiquitous, as household pets, cherished companions, full-time workers, and even, in some cultures, as food.\u000a\u000aDogs and people may communicate better with each other than any other two species.[2] Dogs and humans understand each other on a basic level: we are able to interpret the dog's instinctive body language (along with canine vocalizations like the growl and whine); and the dog, in turn, has an innate ability to respond appropriately both to human body language, as well as to the emotional tone of the human voice. Some research suggests that dogs may be better at interpreting cues from humans than even our closest relatives, the chimpanzees.[3] People can be educated beyond these basics to manage their dogs more precisely, and dogs can be trained to be extremely responsive to people. In addition, dogs can modify the behaviour of their humans to a surprising degree.\u000a\u000aBy the mid-20th century, scientists had generally agreed that the immediate ancestor of the dog must be one of its close living relatives: jackals, coyotes or wolves, but they had trouble deciding on which one.[4] Most early research depended on archeological evidence to try to solve the riddle of the dog's origin.\u000a\u000aThis issue was finally solved using DNA, which proved that the Gray Wolf is the sole ancestor of all modern dogs.[5][6] Therefore, dogs are a subspecies (Canis lupus familiaris) of the Gray Wolf (Canis lupus).[7] The first theories placed original ancestors in Asian populations of the wolves, based on the diversity of comparing the genetic diversity of Asian wolves with that of modern dog breeds[5] while the data is consistent with multiple domestication events.[5][6] However in 2013, scientists analyzing over 100 DNA samples across the world and compared them with 18 ancient European canid samples and discovered the DNA of modern dogs most closely matched that of ancient wolves from Europe, indicating that domestication of dogs began there initiated by hunter-gatherer humans.[8] They also concluded that dogs are descended from a population of ancient European wolves that are now extinct.[9]\u000a\u000aThrough the 1970s and 1980s, schoolchildren were taught that humans domesticated the dog. Nowadays, many scientists feel that a more accurate description would be that the relationship evolved on a more equal footing, with humans and dogs coming together to ensure their mutual survival in a hostile environment. Another way of looking at the question would be to ask if the domestication of the dog was a result of natural selection, in which nature plays the larger part in deciding which dogs survive; in this case the dogs which adapted most readily to humans in their environment, or of artificial selection--humans picking which dogs contributed to the gene pool based on which had traits humans found desirable--the precursor of selective breeding. Surveys and analysis have made cases for both theories.[10]\u000a\u000aThe relationship between humans and dogs is certainly an ancient one. Cave paintings such as one found in Tassili n'Ajjer suggest that primitive man and dog were already living in harmony.[11] Dogs in such images are portrayed as hunters, both in the company of humans and alone, which can be taken as an indication of a developed relationship. Precise dates for these drawings are frequently debated, as they existed before recorded history, and our dating techniques can be affected by many factors, but some of this rock art is several thousand years old. The earliest known domestic dog remains "may date back as far as 10,000 BC, preceding the Neolithic period....evidence indicates that dogs were kept in Jericho by 6500 BC."[12]\u000a\u000aBy the time of the pharaohs, dogs had already established their value as workers and human companions. Egyptian paintings show that selective breeding had already begun; sighthounds were clearly identified. Dog mummies have been found in the tombs of Pharaohs. The Assyrians, Greeks and Romans all used dogs for hunting and as battle companions. Pliny the Elder described the value of dogs in no uncertain terms, and also referred to the existence of--if not refined dog breeds, certainly defined dog types.[13][14][15] A Chinese ceramic statue from the era of the T'ang Dynasty, circa 700 A.D., depicts a dog bearing a resemblance to today's Dandie Dinmont Terrier.[16]\u000a\u000aBy the medieval period, hunters had classified dogs according to the type of game they were best suited to handle.[17]. By the 16th Century, Of Englische Dogges, the first written work specifically and exclusively about dogs, appeared.[18] Illustrations in The Hunt of the Unicorn, a series of medieval tapestries attributed as Flemish, circa 1500, show many domesticated hunting dogs, including hounds and terriers, and one somewhat like a Great Dane.[19]\u000a\u000aModern dog breeds show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal.\u000a\u000aDogs generally share attributes with their wild ancestors, the wolves. Dogs are both predators and scavengers, possessing sharp teeth and strong jaws for attacking, holding, and tearing their food. Although selective breeding has changed the appearance of many breeds, all dogs retain basic traits from their distant ancestors. Like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing. Compared to the bone structure of the human foot, dogs technically walk on their toes.\u000a\u000aBecause the lenses of dogs' eyes are flatter than humans', they cannot see as much detail; on the other hand, their eyes are more sensitive to light and motion than humans' eyes. Some dogs, the sight hounds, have been specifically bred to capitalize on their use of vision in tracking prey. These breeds include the Greyhound and Afghan Hound.[20] The most capable sighthounds have a field of vision up to 270° (compared to 180° for humans). Broad-headed dog breeds with forward set eyes have a much narrower field of vision, sometimes no wider than the human 180 degrees.\u000a\u000aDogs detect sounds as low as the 16 to 20 Hz frequency range (compared to 20 to 70 Hz for humans) and as high as 70 kHz to 100 kHz (compared to 13 to 20 kHz for humans), and in addition have a degree of ear mobility that helps them to rapidly pinpoint the exact location of a sound. Eighteen or more muscles can tilt, rotate and raise or lower a dog's ear. The dog's sensitivity to even very quiet sounds, as compared to a human's, means that a dog can identify a sound's location much faster, as well as hear sounds that are coming from far more distant sources than a human companion by its side.[21]\u000a\u000aThose with more open ear shapes, like the erect ears of wild canids like the fox, generally hear better than those with the floppier ears of many domesticated species.\u000a\u000aDogs have nearly 220 million smell-sensitive cells over an area about the size of a pocket handkerchief (compared to 5 million over an area the size of a postage stamp for humans). It is fair to say that all dogs have a richer olfactory experience than ours. Some breeds have been selectively bred for excellence in detecting scents, over and above their canine brethren, such as the scent hounds, including and particularly Bloodhounds.\u000a\u000aBitches (female dogs) have a reproductive cycle that generally varies from six months to one year, although there are bitches that come into oestrus more or less frequently. This season is the only time that bitches are receptive to mating.\u000a\u000aGestation, the period in which mammals carry their developing young in the uterus, lasts about two months (60-64 days). Whelping (the birth of puppies) usually takes place without incident. The dam (mother) ordinarily gives birth to more than one puppy at a time. The group of pups born together is known as a litter.\u000a\u000aDog breeders mate selected dogs together hoping to reproduce desired traits in the resulting offspring. Those who breed working dogs, such as herders, pick breeding stock that have instincts and abilities suited to the tasks the dogs are required to perform. By contrast, people who breed show dogs have strict sets of criteria to conform to; these are largely related to the dog's appearance and personality.\u000a\u000aSome dog owners view their pets as fully-fledged family members, and most dogs are able to act the part. That ability stems from two basic sources: (1) the "hard-wiring" of the dog's behavior (programmed by its canine genes), and (2) the individual dog's experience with people. Dogs are, like humans, highly social animals. Although the instincts to behave in ways that ease interactions in the pack are inborn in all normal dogs, the right early experiences are critical if puppies are to grow up into companionable dogs. Those "right" experiences have everything to do with contact with people and with other dogs, and they must occur early in the dog's life - probably before the puppy reaches 12 weeks of age.\u000a\u000aWhen puppies are raised with plenty of close contact to people and to other dogs, they become fully socialized. Socialized pups seem to view their human companions as members of their pack, and make few, if any, distinctions between their owners and fellow dogs. As these puppies mature, they can be taught to modify their behavior towards people, and treat their human companions more gently than their canine ones. Puppies who are raised without human nurturing have a harder time adjusting to interactions with owners once they have passed the critical period of about 3 months of age, no matter how much gentle attention is then given them. Orphaned puppies that are bottle fed and raised by humans alone, without any contact to any other dog or puppy, are in danger of becoming abnormally fixated on humans, and such puppies include animals that turn their attentions, sexual and social, to people instead of to dogs. Mounting behavior, for example is an annoyance to visitors and an embarrassment for owners. It not only signals sexual attention, but is a normal part of a dog's dominance behaviour, a tool for determining pack hierarchy. Proper dog-human socialization establishes the human's position as pack leader early, and eliminates the need for such trials.\u000a\u000aThe group of puppies born together is called a litter. That means that most pups are raised in a social group. However, in situations where puppies are isolated from other dogs, and are raised alone, without experiences in canine society, they can fail to learn the give and take of normal puppies. That's one reason that the dog or older puppy adopted from a shelter or obtained from a private seller can pose problems to a new owner. Brought out on a leash in streets where other dogs go by, or let off a leash in a dog park or outdoor space where other dogs are free, a poorly socialized dog may attack other dogs out of fear. Once grown, such pups most often can never be successfully integrated into a group of dogs.\u000a\u000aDogs fill a variety of roles in human society and are often trained as working dogs. Thousands of dogs throughout the world actively herd sheep and cattle, guard people and property, and guide the blind and disabled. Dogs are an important part of rescue work in natural disasters. Their noses aid police and military searches for weapons, drugs, and other contraband. However, the most common (and perhaps most important) role of dogs in many countries is as a human companion.\u000a\u000aJust as one individual animal might have a combination of traits that causes that particular dog to appear so different from another, there are diverse breeds of dogs, where each breed includes dogs that are very similar to each other, but distinct in some identifiable manner from the dogs of a different breed. Through the years, by concentrating particular genes and reducing other ones, breeds have developed in which each member shares a recognizable "brand" of canine style.\u000a\u000aIn kennel club terms, purebred dogs are individuals that have been selected to "breed true". That means that a good example of a pure bred (pedigreed) dog looks like its kind in physical appearance, and acts like its kind in general temperament and certain behaviors. Generally, two purebred parents of the same breed will always produce a litter of pups that will grow up to be quite like them in looks, temperament, and behavior, as opposed to resembling the types of dogs from which the breed originated. The two Chinese Shar Pei youngsters pictured at left show the famously loose and wrinkled skin of their kind, but there are many more characteristics that typify that breed, ranging from a blue-black tongue to a calm, confident stance.\u000a\u000aDogs have an enormous range of normal height and lean weight. The Chihuahua is the smallest of the purebreeds and the Irish Wolfhound is the largest. Despite the great differences in size between these two extremes, all dogs are the same species and can interbreed successfully, although now, thanks to human intervention and the development of dog breeds, care must be taken to only breed individual dogs that are compatible--the mating of a Chihuahua bitch (female) with a Great Dane, for example, would have disastrous consequences for the health of the female dog. Dogs also have an incredibly broad range of coat (fur) and skin colors and patterns, skull and face shape, pelage (fur) length and texture, tail shape and carriage, athletic ability and temperaments. All of these, along with other physical characteristics, are influenced by inherited genes. Even certain specific complex behaviors (like pointing, or retrieving) appear to be inherited in dogs. The gene pool of domestic dogs is highly diverse.\u000a\u000aPresently, over 800 dog breeds are recognized by breed and kennel clubs worldwide. Dogs can be registered with a club and receive certifications (commonly called "papers") that indicate a pedigreed purebred status.\u000a\u000aIn order to qualify for registration, a purebred puppy must have two registered parents of the same breed, and meet the breed standard: a description of a certain "look" (physical conformation) and other features. This breed standard specifies what features are acceptable, which are preferred, and, sometimes, specifies particular features that, if present, disqualify the dog from being chosen as best of its kind. For example, an AKC-registered bulldog with the preferred face, ears, stance, size, and most other qualities of the breed, in an AKC-sanctioned confirmation show, would still be disqualified if it had a "brown or liver-colored nose" [2].\u000a\u000aEach large kennel club hosts dog shows in which points are given for how well an individual dog compares to the breed standard, as compared to others of its type displayed at the same show. The male and female dogs competing in the top kennel clubs must be non-sterilized ("entire") animals and, although the gait and demeanor of the dog is evaluated as each walks around the show ring, the major emphasis is on body features. These contests are sometimes called conformational shows.\u000a\u000aIncreasingly, kennel clubs are catering to dogs and their owners through various shows and events other than conformational shows. The United Kennel Club was an innovator in this area; now such disciplines as agility, tracking, herding and carting are regularly sponsored by the American Kennel Club and others. Dogs may enter these shows and events whether or not they have been sterilized, and some of these events can include non-registered dogs and crossbreds as well.\u000a\u000aOther breeders concentrate on achieving uniform inherited behavioral traits in the dogs they produce. Some consider conformational traits important but secondary, some do not consider a dog's appearance at all, although this is rarer. Working, hunting, and herding dogs raised by field breeders sometimes only generally resemble the breed standard in appearance, but are more likely to be consistent in doing the job.\u000a\u000aThese may include breeds-in-development, breeds recognized in only one country, and breeds where there are differences in type from the variety of the breed recognized by kennel clubs and their affiliates.\u000a\u000aIn some parts of the world the isolation of dogs by geography (islands, mountain passes) has produced so-called natural breeds. These dogs are largely the product of natural selection. Members of a natural breed breed true - adults are similar to each other in appearance and behavior, and produce litters of puppies that not only grow up to resemble their parents, but - once grown, can between themselves propagate more litters of the breed. The Thai Bangkaew Dog is an example of a dog breed believed to have developed through isolation.\u000a\u000aSometimes these natural breeds have also undergone selective breeding by humans who desired a certain type of working dog. Such ancient working breeds include the Greyhound, the Mastiff and the Anatolian Shepherd Dog. Natural breeds made up many of the very first of the registered breeds, and also include some of the most recent additions to the list of breeds officially recognized by kennel clubs. Breed Recognition refers to the fact that a kennel club has officially acknowledged that the breed of dog has been shown to meet the requirements of the particular kennel club. This has nothing to do with the breed\u2019s actual purebred status and the date of official recognition may have no relation to how long the breed has been known to be in existence. The Shar Pei is a natural breed, "having existed for centuries in the southern provinces of China, apparently to the Han dynasty, circa 200 BC".[22] Despite the fact that statues of dogs that look just like the Shar Pei date back to the Thirteenth Century, the breed was not actually \u201crecognized\u201d until the later part of the Twentieth Century (initially by the Hong Kong Kennel Club). Other natural breeds have never been recognized formally by any kennel club.\u000a\u000aCrossbreds or crossbreeds can be loosely defined as animals with at least one known pure breed in its parentage. Crosses between purebreds have been used (along with mixed-breed crosses) to establish most of the long recognized dog breeds. This notwithstanding, today's animal welfare advocates have openly deplored this method for any current propagation of a new breed. That's because it necessarily produces generations of mixed-breed puppies in a world where there is already a great overpopulation of such dogs.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, there are modern dog breeders who purposely mate dogs of two completely different breeds in order to produce a litter of puppies with a set of desired characteristics that are not fully present in either individual parent. Some reasons for this include protecting a longstanding strain of dog that is not yet a true breed (a method used for example to gain official recognition for the Jack Russell Terrier, long-established but only officially recognised within the last ten years or so) or in response to changing times (the cross breeding of dogs to introduce the genes for a naturally short tail to a traditionally docked breed, in response to anti tail-docking legislation, for example). Crossbreeds in development are sometimes called a breed colloquially, but do not fulfill the requirement of "breeding true". It takes many generations of careful matings, and much disappointment along the way, to arrive at a bona fide new breed.\u000a\u000aAlthough the hybrid puppies in the cross between two purebreds (in breeders' terms, the F1 generation) often all look alike, these puppies cannot grow up and be mated to other dogs that were born of the same crossed parentage and reliably produce new puppies that are like them.\u000a\u000aThe breeders of notable crosses such as Cocker Spaniel-Poodle crosses, \u201cCockapoos\u201d and Labrador Retriever\u2013Poodle crosses \u201cLabradoodles\u201d, point out that development of a new breed is a worthy goal, and that, with ethical breeding practices, all puppies can be properly placed. In addition, some large commercial breeding operations that supply hybrid dogs claim to sell their puppies to pet shops under an agreement that every puppy is to be sterilized and therefore cannot ever used for breeding, this helps reduce indiscriminate breeding.\u000a\u000aDogs that came from parents who were not of any pure breed, or whose bloodlines comprise more than one breed, are called mongrels, mutts, or mixed-breed dogs. There are many other names for them, with varying levels of acceptability. The word \u2018\u2019mongrel\u2019\u2019, generally taken to be the correct formal word in dog fancy, is considered insulting by some dog lovers. That's probably because, in the English language, this word has sub-meanings that imply a lesser worth. However, it is fair to say that all dogs are derived from mongrels, and many scientists believe that in the absence of selective breeding, the dog would revert to the little brown pariah dog believed to be its most recent ancestor. Even the staunch proponents of purebreds generally agree that as pets, mixed-breed dogs offer their owners the same qualities of loyalty, intelligence and companionship that have come to be associated with dogs.\u000a\u000aBoth anecdotal evidence and scientific research suggest that dogs have a reasonably high intelligence. This intelligence is expressed differently in different breeds and individuals, along with sets of specific behaviors and talents that appear to be inherited. Optimal socialization and training of an individual dog is partly dependent on its own intelligence, inherited behaviors, and temperament.\u000a\u000aThe qualities characterized under the categories behaviour and temperament can have overlapping elements. These are related to intelligence, instinct and individual ability. They are often shaped by a dog\u2019s individual personality and can be modified by training.\u000a\u000aFormal training in obedience and other disciplines is offered by many kennel clubs and private training organizations.\u000a\u000aPolice and military organizations typically run their own specialized training or contract with specialists expert in this exacting work. These are typically referred to as K-9 (canine) units, where dogs are trained to sniff out drugs or explosives, rescue trapped or lost people, or attack on command. These are often considered on a par with their human handlers in many respects; for example, when one dies or is killed in action, they are accorded full ceremonial funerals.\u000a\u000aSince socialization to people and other dogs is part of the general training of puppies, many of the specialized training programs designed for dogs are given in classes. Not only do the dogs learn the skills taught, but they also learn to interact properly in a group situation.\u000a\u000aIf given the opportunity, dogs are omnivores, eating plant materials and animals. Generally, dogs will both scavenge carcasses and kill and eat animal prey.\u000a\u000aJust as there are schools of thought about human diet, with advocates of various strict regimens ranging from macrobiotics to raw foods, there are a number of diets recommended for dogs that involve an entire philosophy of dog health. The BARF diet is one with a large following. There are breeders who insist that puppies purchased from them be maintained on particular diets, and generally their wishes should be respected.\u000a\u000aWhen purchasing a puppy from a breeder, or adopting from a shelter, it is wise to find out the diet that the animal has been maintained on, and to make only gradual changes.\u000a\u000aIt is probably best to feed dogs a varied diet, supplemented with vitamins or high-quality commercial dog food. Most standard dog care guides stress that dogs should not be fed table scraps. This is because cooked bones can splinter internally, human food recipes can contain substances harmful for dogs, such as onions, and the fat in most table scraps is not any better for dogs than for people. In any case, there are widely-varying opinions and dogs have been known to do well on commercial food, raw food, home-cooked food, or, when their health requires it, special or restricted diets. When in doubt, dog owners should be guided by the advise of a veterinarian.\u000a\u000aIn the developed world, excessive fat is a problem for many dogs. Obese dogs can have health problems, and can benefit from restriction of calories in the diet and from increased exercise. Puppies, especially large and giant breed puppies, can suffer joint problems if fed too much highly nutritious food early on.\u000a\u000aDogs are susceptible to various diseases, ailments, and poisons, some of which affect humans in the same way, others of which are unique to dogs. Dogs, like all mammals, are also susceptible to heat exhaustion when dealing with high levels of humidity and/or extreme temperatures.[23]\u000a\u000aMost diseases are species-specific; so generally the diseases that affect dogs cannot be transmitted to humans, and vice versa. Rabies is an exception to this rule (see below). (Compare this with parasites, many of which can be transmitted between species.) Infectious diseases commonly associated with dogs include rabies (hydrophobia), canine parvovirus, and canine distemper. Congenital diseases of dogs can include a wide range from hip dysplasia and medial patellar luxation to epilepsy and pulmonic stenosis. Except for the many infections which are species specific, dogs are susceptible to the same ailments that humans are, including diabetes, epilepsy, hypothyroidism, dental disease, heart disease, cancer, and arthritis.\u000a\u000aImmunizations are available for many of the infectious diseases that affect dogs. Some of these diseases are passed from dog to dog, others to dogs through insects. Vaccinations for canine distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parainfluenza, canine parvovirus, Lyme disease and rabies are available. Some of these are combined in "one shot", and one - rabies - is often legally required of dog owners to provide for their dogs. That's because rabies is a fatal disease that can be transmitted by the bite of an infected dog.\u000a\u000aSome of these illnesses are only prevalent in certain regions of the world, and the selection of which immunizations is important varies according to geography.\u000a\u000aUnlike diseases, some parasites can be passed between dogs and humans. Common external parasites are various species of fleas, ticks, and mites. Internal parasites include hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms, and heartworms.\u000a\u000aGenerally, prevention of these parasites involves the administration of a systemic medicine or the use of applied chemicals through the wearing of collars or other means.\u000a\u000aSome categories of dogs are especially prone to certain genetic ailments, such as hip dysplasia, luxating patellae or cleft palate. Occasionally genetic disorders can be breed-related: blindness and deafness are disorders than have been linked to genes in specific breeds. Gastric torsion and bloat is a dangerous problem in some large-chested breeds.\u000a\u000aThe typical lifespan of dogs varies considerably by breed, and seems to be somewhat related to size. For example, many giant dog breeds average only 7 or 8 years, while some small terrier breeds might live as long as 20 years.The average lifespan for mixed-breed and midsize dogs is about 13 to 14 years.\u000a\u000aThere is no hard-and fast rule for the choosing of a pet. Among the many decisions that has to be made are whether to pick a purebred, crossbred or mutt, and what the individual can afford. Besides the initial outlay, the maintenance of dogs can be costly: food, shelter, training, health and dental care, emergency services, and boarding or home care all have to be considered. Dog owner's should be aware that, like humans, there are higher costs at the early and latter stages of a dog's life, when they have specialized needs.\u000a\u000aIn addition, owners should give consideration to what will happen to the dog in the event of the human's incapcity or death, and custody of family dogs in the event of divorce or separation.\u000a\u000aAlmost every breed of dog has an organized group of fanciers promoting it. Doing an internet search on the breed will yield a number of breeder sites, along with the various fanciers' organizations' web sites. Usually, one or more of the sites will list not only the attributes that are wonderful features of the breed, but any special health problems along with information for diagnosis and treatment.\u000a\u000aFinally, it is probably best to give some thought to the final disposition of the remains of a deceased dog, so that those decisions do not have to be made when one is grieving for a lost friend.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Humane Society of the United States, 3-4 million dogs and cats are euthanized each year in the United States and many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes. Spaying or neutering dogs helps keep overpopulation down.[3] Local humane societies, SPCAs and other animal protection organizations urge people to spay or neuter their pets and to adopt animals from shelters instead of purchasing them.\u000a\u000aIn the wild, in areas where wolves still roam but the human population is also established, there is the occasional inter-breeding of wolf and dog. Since a wolf pack is not likely to perceive a dog as anything but prey, and a domestic dog is unlikely to survive attack from even a lone wolf, this is not as common as the interbreeding of dogs and coyotes in similar circumstances. When dogs and coyotes do interbreed in the wild, the resulting hybrids often fail to thrive because they lack behavior features of the wild canine parent. For example, the domestic bitch ordinarily comes into heat twice or more times a year, where as the coyote female is fertile only once a year. The timing of the dog's estrus does not correspond to the local seasons in a way that is advantageous to a newborn litter, and so puppies born in the lean times of winter or drought are more likely to die. The instinct to only allow one mating pair of animals in the pack and the nurturing instincts of other pack members ( including the males) towards that pair's pups, is almost completely lost in the dog; and so hybrids in the wild are less able to raise litters that survive.\u000a\u000aIn human society, there are people who selectively breed wolves and dogs as pets. In many areas, there are currently laws against keeping wolves in captivity, but there are regions where this is not the case. Often, the breeder of these hybrids works not from full wolves, but selects a hybrid wolf/dog as one parent, and either another hybrid or a domestic dog as the other parent.\u000a\u000aMolecular genetic research has shown that dogs appear to have been domesticated from wolves, but not from wolves in general - instead, selected individual ancient wolves were kept and interbred. There is speculation that among the wolves that harried these early human settlements or frequented ancient dumps, the particular individuals chosen for "adoption" by people were probably not only very young - but were exceptionally "nice". There is variation in behavioral characteristics of individual members in every large group of wolves. It is not likely that the wild wolf pup who is at the extreme for aggressiveness, for example, would be tolerated in human society - once grown into an adult wolf, even if originally adopted in its infancy.\u000a\u000aThat has been the overall situation with wolf/dog hybrids. Even if carefully raised from birth, some adult wolf/dogs do not remain "tame" enough to safely interact with people. Breeders of wolf/dog hybrids routinely remove the puppies from the mother by 2-3 weeks of age, and hand raise them, bottle feeding the puppies every few hours. Each puppy is allowed contact with at least one other puppy, but all puppies are kept isolated from adult dogs and wolves (including their own mother) because if they are allowed contact they usually will not bond to their human handlers. That, of course, is not the case in pure domestic dog puppies, who can ordinarily be raised in the home with free access to both mother and human companions. Even with special nurturing of wolf/dog pups, and even though these hybrid puppies are usually much less than 50% wolf, there is an extremely high rate of attacks on humans by adult hybrid wolf/dogs - including the members of the human family that raised them. Breeders of hybrid wolf/dogs counsel that these dogs must at all times be fenced off from any possible contact with strangers [4]. Fatal human attacks by hybrids are not rare, and often victimize children.

VUnited States, officially United States of America, abbreviations U.S. or U.S.A., byname America,  country of North America, a federal republic of 50 states. Besides the 48 contiguous states that occupy the middle latitudes of the continent, the United States includes the state of Alaska, at the northwestern extreme of North America, and the island state of Hawaii, in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The coterminous states are bounded on the north by Canada, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. The United States is the fourth largest country in the world in area (after Russia, Canada, and China). The national capital is Washington, which is coextensive with the District of Columbia, the federal capital region created in 1790.\u000a\u000aThe major characteristic of the United States is probably its great variety. Its physical environment ranges from the Arctic to the subtropical, from the moist rain forest to the arid desert, from the rugged mountain peak to the flat prairie. Although the total population of the United States is large by world standards, its overall population density is relatively low; the country embraces some of the world\u2019s largest urban concentrations as well as some of the most extensive areas that are almost devoid of habitation.\u000a\u000aThe United States contains a highly diverse population; but, unlike a country such as China that largely incorporated indigenous peoples, its diversity has to a great degree come from an immense and sustained global immigration. Probably no other country has a wider range of racial, ethnic, and cultural types than does the United States. In addition to the presence of surviving native Americans (including American Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimo) and the descendants of Africans taken as slaves to America, the national character has been enriched, tested, and constantly redefined by the tens of millions of immigrants who by and large have gone to America hoping for greater social, political, and economic opportunities than they had in the places they left.\u000a\u000aThe United States is the world\u2019s greatest economic power, measured in terms of gross national product (GNP). The nation\u2019s wealth is partly a reflection of its rich natural resources and its enormous agricultural output, but it owes more to the country\u2019s highly developed industry. Despite its relative economic self-sufficiency in many areas, the United States is the most important single factor in world trade by virtue of the sheer size of its economy. Its exports and imports represent major proportions of the world total. The United States also impinges on the global economy as a source of and as a destination for investment capital. The country continues to sustain an economic life that is more diversified than any other on Earth, providing the majority of its people with one of the world\u2019s highest standards of living.\u000a\u000aThe United States is relatively young by world standards, being barely more than 200 years old; it achieved its current size only in the mid-20th century. America was the first of the European colonies to separate successfully from its motherland, and it was the first nation to be established on the premise that sovereignty rests with its citizens and not with the government. In its first century and a half, the country was mainly preoccupied with its own territorial expansion and economic growth and with social debates that ultimately led to civil war and a healing period that is still not complete. In the 20th century the United States emerged as a world power, and since World War II it has been one of the preeminent powers. It has not accepted this mantle easily nor always carried it willingly; the principles and ideals of its founders have been tested by the pressures and exigencies of its dominant status. Although the United States still offers its residents opportunities for unparalleled personal advancement and wealth, the depletion of its resources, contamination of its environment, and continuing social and economic inequality that perpetuates areas of poverty and blight all threaten the fabric of the country.\u000a\u000aThe District of Columbia is discussed in the article Washington. For discussion of other major U.S. cities, see the articles Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. Political units in association with the United States include Puerto Rico, discussed in the article Puerto Rico, and several Pacific islands, discussed in Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa.

VA prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that can be evenly divided by only two different positive whole numbers, namely 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.\u000a\u000aA prime number cannot be expressed as the product [1] of two numbers and , i.e. as , except for the trivial factorizations that all numbers possess.\u000a\u000aWith the exception of 2, all prime numbers are odd numbers, but not every odd number is prime. For example, and so neither 9 nor 15 is prime.\u000a\u000aThe study of prime numbers has a long history, going back to ancient times, and it remains an active part of number theory today. Although the study of prime numbers used to be an interesting but not terribly useful area of mathematical research, today it has important applications. Understanding properties of prime numbers and their generalizations is essential to modern cryptography \u2014 in particular to public key ciphers that are crucial to Internet commerce, wireless networks, and military applications. Less well-known is that other computer algorithms also depend on properties of prime numbers.\u000a\u000aThe importance of prime numbers in arithmetic comes in large part from the unique factorization of numbers. Every number can be written as a product of prime factors, and all such expressions for any particular will contain the same factors, differing only in the sequence in which they are listed.\u000a\u000aFor example, we can write , where all of the factors in the product are prime numbers; there is no other way of writing 5040 as a product of prime numbers except by rearranging the prime factors we already have, such as .\u000a\u000aThe existence of a single unique factorization into prime numbers is formalized as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. The fundamental property of the integers which it expresses is a critical building block in many of the important results in the area of elementary number theory. An analogy can be made between the role prime numbers play in arithmetic and the role atoms play in chemistry. [2]\u000a\u000aIt is this aspect of prime numbers that is of such interest to modern cryptography, in particular in the area of public key ciphers, as mentioned above. The most popular of these ciphers depends for its security on the difficulty of factoring extremely large numbers (many hundreds of digits in length) into their prime factors; were a fast algorithm for doing so to be discovered, some of today's most sophisticated ciphers would be instantly broken.\u000a\u000aIt might be intuitive to consider 1 a prime number, and in the past, mathematicians often did consider it to be a prime. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is a good example of why mathematicians have changed their minds on this point over the last century, and have definitively revised the formal definition of 'prime number' so that 1 is no longer included.\u000a\u000aThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is no longer strictly true if 1 is considered prime. Consider, for example - two different prime factorizations. Rather than adjust the formal definition of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, it is much easier to simply exclude 1 from the definition of the set of prime numbers.\u000a\u000aThis is an example of a more general trend in mathematics over the past century, which is to be much more careful in the treatment of 0 and 1 (which are very special numbers, with unusual properties that no other numbers have). Mathematicians need to be especially precise in statements that include them.[3]\u000a\u000aOne basic fact about the prime numbers is that there are infinitely many of them. In other words, the list of prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ... never stops. There are a number of ways of showing that there are infinitely many primes, but one of the oldest and most familiar proofs goes back go Euclid.\u000a\u000aEuclid proved that for any finite set of prime numbers, there is always another prime number that is not in that set. Choose any finite set of prime numbers . Then the number\u000a\u000apresents a problem. On the one hand, the number is a multiple of , and multiples of the same prime number are never next to each other, so N itself can't be a multiple of . The same argument actually shows that itself cannot be a multiple of any of the prime numbers . On the other hand, every number is divisible by some prime. (For example, its smallest divisor greater than 1 must be a prime.[4])\u000a\u000aThis shows that there is at least one prime number (namely, the smallest divisor of N greater than 1) that is excluded from our initial finite set. Since any finite set of prime numbers can thus be extended to a larger finite set of prime numbers, we conclude that there are infinitely many prime numbers.\u000a\u000aAlthough most other proofs of the infinitude of prime numbers are more complicated, they can also provide more information. One mathematical milestone known as the Prime Number Theorem estimates how many of the numbers between 1 and x are prime numbers (see below). Another such proof is Euler's demonstration that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges to \u221e.\u000a\u000aHow can we tell which numbers are prime and which are not? It is sometimes possible to tell that a number is not prime by looking at its digits: for example, any number whose last digit is even is divisble by 2, and any number ending with 5 or 0 is divisible by 5. Therefore, except for the prime numbers 2 and 5, any prime number must end with the digit 1, 3, 7, or 9. This check can be used to rule out the possibility of a randomly chosen number being prime more than half of the time, but numbers that end with 1, 3, 7, or 9 often have divisors that are harder to spot.\u000a\u000aTo find large prime numbers, we must use a systematic procedure \u2014 an algorithm. Nowadays, prime-finding calculations are performed by computers, often using very complicated algorithms, but there are simple algorithms that can be carried out by hand if the numbers are small. In fact, the simplest methods for locating prime numbers are some of the oldest algorithms, known since antiquity. Two classical algorithms are called trial division and the sieve of Eratosthenes.\u000a\u000aTrial division consists of systematically searching the list of numbers for a divisor; if none is found, the number is prime. If n has a small divisor, we can quit as soon as we've found it, but in the worst case \u2014 if n is prime \u2014 we have to test all numbers to be sure. This algorithm can be improved by realizing the following: if n has a divisor a that is larger than , there must be another divisor b that is smaller than . Thus, it is sufficient to look for a divisor up to . This makes a significant difference: for example, we only need to try dividing by 2, 3, ..., 31 to verify that 997 is prime, rather than all the numbers 2, 3, ..., 996. Trial division might be described as follows using pseudocode:\u000a\u000aThe Sieve of Eratosthenes not only provides a method for testing a number to see if it is prime, but also for enumerating the (infinite) set of prime numbers. The idea of the method to write down a list of numbers starting from 2 ranging up to some limit, say:\u000a\u000aThe first number (2) is prime, so we mark it, and cross out all of its multiples:\u000a\u000aThe smallest unmarked number is 3, so we mark it and cross out all its multiples (some of which may already have been crossed out):\u000a\u000aThe smallest unmarked number (5) is the next prime, so we mark it and cross out all of its multiples:\u000a\u000aNotice that there are no multiples of 5 that have not already been crossed out, but that doesn't matter at this stage. Proceeding as before, we add 7, 11, 13, 17 and 19 to our list of primes:\u000a\u000aWe have now found all prime numbers up to 20.\u000a\u000aIt is evident that the prime numbers are randomly distributed but, unfortunately, we don't know what 'random' means. \u2014 R. C. Vaughan\u000a\u000aThe list of prime numbers suggests that they thin out the further you go: 44% of the one-digit numbers are prime, but only 23% of the two-digit numbers and 16% of the three-digit numbers. The trial division method explained above provides an intuitive explanation. To test whether a number is prime, you have to try whether it can be divided by all numbers between 2 and . Large numbers have to undergo more tests, so fewer of them will be prime.\u000a\u000aThe Prime Number Theorem explains how fast the prime numbers thin out. It says that if you are looking around the number , about one in every numbers is prime (here, denotes the natural logarithm of ). The formal statement of the prime number theorem is\u000a\u000awhere is the number of primes\u000a\u000aThere are many unsolved problems concerning prime numbers. A few such problems (posed as conjectures) are:\u000a\u000aTwin primes are pairs of prime numbers differing by 2. Examples of twin primes include 5 and 7, 11 and 13, and 41 and 43. The Twin Prime Conjecture states that there are an infinite number of these pairs.\u000a\u000aThe Goldbach conjecture states that every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. For example, if you choose the even number 48, you can find where 41 and 7 are prime numbers.\u000a\u000aPrime numbers having special forms are important in various applications. For instance, Fermat primes are prime numbers that can be written as for some positive integer n. Such prime numbers make a surprising appearance in the solution to the problem of which regular polygons can be constructed with a straight-edge and compass. Many unsolved problems ask whether there are infinitely many primes of a certain form. For instance, it is unknown if there are infinitely many Fermat primes, Mersenne primes, or Sophie-Germain primes. See the Related articles subpage for a list of special types of primes.\u000a\u000aA prime number is usually defined as a positive integer other than 1 that is (evenly) divisible only by 1 and itself. However, there is another way of defining prime numbers, and that is the observation that a number is prime if in all cases where it can evenly divide the product of two numbers, and , it must also evenly divide one of those two numbers.\u000a\u000aA simple counter-example is that 4 evenly divides 12 (i.e. is a factor of 12), but 4 does not divide 2 and 4 does not divide 6 even though 12 is 2 times 6. This means that 4 is not a prime number.\u000a\u000aThis example illustrates the principle at work in this definition; when the number cannot evenly divide one of the two numbers, either or , it must be made up of two factors, one of which divides one of the numbers ( ), and the other the second number ( ).\u000a\u000aIf the first characterization of prime numbers is taken as the definition, the second is derived from it as a theorem (known as Euclid's lemma), and vice versa.\u000a\u000aWe may express this second possible definition in mathematical notation as follows: A number (natural number) is prime if for any such that (read p divides ab), either or .\u000a\u000aIt may feel natural to take the first of the two characterizations we gave as the definition. However, when one generalizes the concept of "integer", and starts considering algebraic integers, it becomes clear that, while one can study elements that are divisible only by units and (unit multiples of) themselves, these elements need not have all of the habitual properties of prime numbers. Thus, it has become customary to call such elements irreducible, and to reserve the adjective prime for prime ideals, which are objects whose definition mimics the second characterization of prime numbers given above. (Algebraic integers factorize uniquely into prime ideals, but not, in general, into irreducibles; this is the main reason why prime ideals deserve the label prime in their name, whereas irreducibles are deprived of it.)\u000a\u000aThere are rings -- including the "usual" integers -- in which all irreducible elements generate prime ideals, and all prime ideals are generated by irreducible elements. (In and a few other rings, the proof of this statement is based on the fact that the remainder of a division is smaller than the divisor. Rings for which this is true are called Euclidean domains.) In many rings, however, irreducible elements may generate non-prime ideals, and a prime ideal may fail to be generated by any irreducible element (or by any one element of the ring).\u000a\u000a(Note that Scharlau and Opolka was originally published as:  ).

VBiology is a natural science concerned with the study of life and living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, evolution, distribution, and taxonomy.[1] Modern biology is a vast and eclectic field, composed of many branches and subdisciplines. However, despite the broad scope of biology, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating it into single, coherent fields. In general, biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and evolution as the engine that propels the synthesis and creation of new species. It is also understood today that all organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment to maintain a stable and vital condition.\u000a\u000aSubdisciplines of biology are defined by the scale at which organisms are studied, the kinds of organisms studied, and the methods used to study them: Biochemistry examines the rudimentary chemistry of life; molecular biology studies the complex interactions among biological molecules; botany studies the biology of plants; cellular biology examines the basic building-block of all life, the cell; physiology examines the physical and chemical functions of tissues, organs, and organ systems of an organism; evolutionary biology examines the processes that produced the diversity of life; and ecology examines how organisms interact in their environment.[2]\u000a\u000aThe term biology is derived from the Greek word \u03b2\u03af\u03bf\u03c2, bios, "life" and the suffix -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1, -logia, "study of."[3][4] The Latin form of the term first appeared in 1736 when Linnaeus (Carl von Linné) used biologi in his Bibliotheca botanica. It was used again in 1766 in a work entitled Philosophiae naturalis sive physicae: tomus III, continens geologian, biologian, phytologian generalis, by Michael Christoph Hanov, a disciple of Christian Wolff. The first German use, Biologie, was used in a 1771 translation of Linnaeus' work. In 1797, Theodor Georg August Roose used the term in a book, Grundzüge der Lehre van der Lebenskraft, in the preface. Karl Friedrich Burdach used the term in 1800 in a more restricted sense of the study of human beings from a morphological, physiological and psychological perspective (Propädeutik zum Studien der gesammten Heilkunst). The term came into its modern usage with the six-volume treatise Biologie, oder Philosophie der lebenden Natur (1802\u201322) by Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus, who announced:[5]\u000a\u000aAlthough modern biology is a relatively recent development, sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times. Natural philosophy was studied as early as the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indian subcontinent, and China. However, the origins of modern biology and its approach to the study of nature are most often traced back to ancient Greece.[6] While the formal study of medicine dates back to Hippocrates (ca. 460 BC \u2013 ca. 370 BC), it was Aristotle (384 BC \u2013 322 BC) who contributed most extensively to the development of biology. Especially important are his History of Animals and other works where he showed naturalist leanings, and later more empirical works that focused on biological causation and the diversity of life. Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, wrote a series of books on botany that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to the plant sciences, even into the Middle Ages.[7]\u000a\u000aScholars of the medieval Islamic world who wrote on biology included al-Jahiz (781\u2013869), Al-Dinawari (828\u2013896), who wrote on botany,[8] and Rhazes (865\u2013925) who wrote on anatomy and physiology. Medicine was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought, especially in upholding a fixed hierarchy of life.\u000a\u000aBiology began to quickly develop and grow with Anton van Leeuwenhoek's dramatic improvement of the microscope. It was then that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and helped to develop the basic techniques of microscopic dissection and staining.[9]\u000a\u000aAdvances in microscopy also had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell. Then, in 1838, Schleiden and Schwann began promoting the now universal ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of life, although they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks to the work of Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow, however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as cell theory.[10][11]\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians. Carl Linnaeus published a basic taxonomy for the natural world in 1735 (variations of which have been in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced scientific names for all his species.[12] Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable\u2014even suggesting the possibility of common descent. Though he was opposed to evolution, Buffon is a key figure in the history of evolutionary thought; his work influenced the evolutionary theories of both Lamarck and Darwin.[13]\u000a\u000aSerious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who was the first to present a coherent theory of evolution.[14] He posited that evolution was the result of environmental stress on properties of animals, meaning that the more frequently and rigorously an organ was used, the more complex and efficient it would become, thus adapting the animal to its environment. Lamarck believed that these acquired traits could then be passed on to the animal's offspring, who would further develop and perfect them.[15] However, it was the British naturalist Charles Darwin, combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, Malthus's writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations, who forged a more successful evolutionary theory based on natural selection; similar reasoning and evidence led Alfred Russel Wallace to independently reach the same conclusions.[16][17] Although it was the subject of controversy (which continues to this day), Darwin's theory quickly spread through the scientific community and soon became a central axiom of the rapidly developing science of biology.\u000a\u000aThe discovery of the physical representation of heredity came along with evolutionary principles and population genetics. In the 1940s and early 1950s, experiments pointed to DNA as the component of chromosomes that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as genes. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as viruses and bacteria, along with the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA in 1953, marked the transition to the era of molecular genetics. From the 1950s to present times, biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain. The genetic code was cracked by Har Gobind Khorana, Robert W. Holley and Marshall Warren Nirenberg after DNA was understood to contain codons. Finally, the Human Genome Project was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general human genome. This project was essentially completed in 2003,[18] with further analysis still being published. The Human Genome Project was the first step in a globalized effort to incorporate accumulated knowledge of biology into a functional, molecular definition of the human body and the bodies of other organisms.\u000a\u000aCell theory states that the cell is the fundamental unit of life, and that all living things are composed of one or more cells or the secreted products of those cells (e.g. shells). All cells arise from other cells through cell division. In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes.[19] In addition, the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in processes that are part of the function known as metabolism. Finally, cells contain hereditary information (DNA), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division.\u000a\u000aA central organizing concept in biology is that life changes and develops through evolution, and that all life-forms known have a common origin. The theory of evolution postulates that all organisms on the Earth, both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral gene pool. This last universal common ancestor of all organisms is believed to have appeared about 3.5 billion years ago.[20] Biologists generally regard the universality and ubiquity of the genetic code as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (see: origin of life).[21]\u000a\u000aIntroduced into the scientific lexicon by Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck in 1809,[22] evolution was established by Charles Darwin fifty years later as a viable scientific model when he articulated its driving force: natural selection.[23][24][25] (Alfred Russel Wallace is recognized as the co-discoverer of this concept as he helped research and experiment with the concept of evolution.)[26] Evolution is now used to explain the great variations of life found on Earth.\u000a\u000aDarwin theorized that species and breeds developed through the processes of natural selection and artificial selection or selective breeding.[27] Genetic drift was embraced as an additional mechanism of evolutionary development in the modern synthesis of the theory.[28]\u000a\u000aThe evolutionary history of the species\u2014which describes the characteristics of the various species from which it descended\u2014together with its genealogical relationship to every other species is known as its phylogeny. Widely varied approaches to biology generate information about phylogeny. These include the comparisons of DNA sequences conducted within molecular biology or genomics, and comparisons of fossils or other records of ancient organisms in paleontology.[29] Biologists organize and analyze evolutionary relationships through various methods, including phylogenetics, phenetics, and cladistics. (For a summary of major events in the evolution of life as currently understood by biologists, see evolutionary timeline.)\u000a\u000aGenes are the primary units of inheritance in all organisms. A gene is a unit of heredity and corresponds to a region of DNA that influences the form or function of an organism in specific ways. All organisms, from bacteria to animals, share the same basic machinery that copies and translates DNA into proteins. Cells transcribe a DNA gene into an RNA version of the gene, and a ribosome then translates the RNA into a protein, a sequence of amino acids. The translation code from RNA codon to amino acid is the same for most organisms, but slightly different for some. For example, a sequence of DNA that codes for insulin in humans also codes for insulin when inserted into other organisms, such as plants.[30]\u000a\u000aDNA usually occurs as linear chromosomes in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. A chromosome is an organized structure consisting of DNA and histones. The set of chromosomes in a cell and any other hereditary information found in the mitochondria, chloroplasts, or other locations is collectively known as its genome. In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is located in the cell nucleus, along with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid.[31] The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its genotype.[32]\u000a\u000aHomeostasis is the ability of an open system to regulate its internal environment to maintain stable conditions by means of multiple dynamic equilibrium adjustments controlled by interrelated regulation mechanisms. All living organisms, whether unicellular or multicellular, exhibit homeostasis.[34]\u000a\u000aTo maintain dynamic equilibrium and effectively carry out certain functions, a system must detect and respond to perturbations. After the detection of a perturbation, a biological system normally responds through negative feedback. This means stabilizing conditions by either reducing or increasing the activity of an organ or system. One example is the release of glucagon when sugar levels are too low.\u000a\u000aThe survival of a living organism depends on the continuous input of energy. Chemical reactions that are responsible for its structure and function are tuned to extract energy from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them. In this process, molecules of chemical substances that constitute food play two roles; first, they contain energy that can be transformed for biological chemical reactions; second, they develop new molecular structures made up of biomolecules.\u000a\u000aThe organisms responsible for the introduction of energy into an ecosystem are known as producers or autotrophs. Nearly all of these organisms originally draw energy from the sun.[35] Plants and other phototrophs use solar energy via a process known as photosynthesis to convert raw materials into organic molecules, such as ATP, whose bonds can be broken to release energy.[36] A few ecosystems, however, depend entirely on energy extracted by chemotrophs from methane, sulfides, or other non-luminal energy sources.[37]\u000a\u000aSome of the captured energy is used to produce biomass to sustain life and provide energy for growth and development. The majority of the rest of this energy is lost as heat and waste molecules. The most important processes for converting the energy trapped in chemical substances into energy useful to sustain life are metabolism[38] and cellular respiration.[39]\u000a\u000aMolecular biology is the study of biology at a molecular level.[40] This field overlaps with other areas of biology, particularly with genetics and biochemistry. Molecular biology chiefly concerns itself with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell, including the interrelationship of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and learning how these interactions are regulated.\u000a\u000aCell biology studies the structural and physiological properties of cells, including their behaviors, interactions, and environment. This is done on both the microscopic and molecular levels, for unicellular organisms such as bacteria, as well as the specialized cells in multicellular organisms such as humans. Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences. The similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology.\u000a\u000aAnatomy considers the forms of macroscopic structures such as organs and organ systems.[41]\u000a\u000aGenetics is the science of genes, heredity, and the variation of organisms.[42][43] Genes encode the information necessary for synthesizing proteins, which in turn play a central role in influencing the final phenotype of the organism. In modern research, genetics provides important tools in the investigation of the function of a particular gene, or the analysis of genetic interactions. Within organisms, genetic information generally is carried in chromosomes, where it is represented in the chemical structure of particular DNA molecules.\u000a\u000aDevelopmental biology studies the process by which organisms grow and develop. Originating in embryology, modern developmental biology studies the genetic control of cell growth, differentiation, and "morphogenesis," which is the process that progressively gives rise to tissues, organs, and anatomy. Model organisms for developmental biology include the round worm Caenorhabditis elegans,[44] the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,[45] the zebrafish Danio rerio,[46] the mouse Mus musculus,[47] and the weed Arabidopsis thaliana.[48][49] (A model organism is a species that is extensively studied to understand particular biological phenomena, with the expectation that discoveries made in that organism provide insight into the workings of other organisms.)[50]\u000a\u000aPhysiology studies the mechanical, physical, and biochemical processes of living organisms by attempting to understand how all of the structures function as a whole. The theme of "structure to function" is central to biology. Physiological studies have traditionally been divided into plant physiology and animal physiology, but some principles of physiology are universal, no matter what particular organism is being studied. For example, what is learned about the physiology of yeast cells can also apply to human cells. The field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of human physiology to non-human species. Plant physiology borrows techniques from both research fields.\u000a\u000aPhysiology studies how for example nervous, immune, endocrine, respiratory, and circulatory systems, function and interact. The study of these systems is shared with medically oriented disciplines such as neurology and immunology.\u000a\u000aEvolutionary research is concerned with the origin and descent of species, as well as their change over time, and includes scientists from many taxonomically oriented disciplines. For example, it generally involves scientists who have special training in particular organisms such as mammalogy, ornithology, botany, or herpetology, but use those organisms as systems to answer general questions about evolution.\u000a\u000aEvolutionary biology is partly based on paleontology, which uses the fossil record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution,[51] and partly on the developments in areas such as population genetics.[52] In the 1980s, developmental biology re-entered evolutionary biology from its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study of evolutionary developmental biology.[53] Related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology are phylogenetics, systematics, and taxonomy.\u000a\u000aMultiple speciation events create a tree structured system of relationships between species. The role of systematics is to study these relationships and thus the differences and similarities between species and groups of species.[54] However, systematics was an active field of research long before evolutionary thinking was common.[55]\u000a\u000aTraditionally, living things have been divided into five kingdoms: Monera; Protista; Fungi; Plantae; Animalia.[56] However, many scientists now consider this five-kingdom system outdated. Modern alternative classification systems generally begin with the three-domain system: Archaea (originally Archaebacteria); Bacteria (originally Eubacteria) and Eukaryota (including protists, fungi, plants, and animals)[57] These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of key biomolecules such as ribosomes.[57]\u000a\u000aFurther, each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is: Domain; Kingdom; Phylum; Class; Order; Family; Genus; Species.\u000a\u000aOutside of these categories, there are obligate intracellular parasites that are "on the edge of life"[58] in terms of metabolic activity, meaning that many scientists do not actually classify these structures as alive, due to their lack of at least one or more of the fundamental functions or characteristics that define life. They are classified as viruses, viroids, prions, or satellites.\u000a\u000aThe scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as Homo sapiens. Homo is the genus, and sapiens the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.[59][60]\u000a\u000aThe dominant classification system is called the Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature. How organisms are named is governed by international agreements such as the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN), the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), and the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria (ICNB). The classification of viruses, viroids, prions, and all other sub-viral agents that demonstrate biological characteristics is conducted by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and is known as the International Code of Viral Classification and Nomenclature (ICVCN).[61][62][63][64] However, several other viral classification systems do exist.\u000a\u000aA merging draft, BioCode, was published in 1997 in an attempt to standardize nomenclature in these three areas, but has yet to be formally adopted.[65] The BioCode draft has received little attention since 1997; its originally planned implementation date of January 1, 2000, has passed unnoticed. A revised BioCode that, instead of replacing the existing codes, would provide a unified context for them, was proposed in 2011.[66][67][68] However, the International Botanical Congress of 2011 declined to consider the BioCode proposal. The ICVCN remains outside the BioCode, which does not include viral classification.\u000a\u000aEcology studies the distribution and abundance of living organisms, and the interactions between organisms and their environment.[69] The habitat of an organism can be described as the local abiotic factors such as climate and ecology, in addition to the other organisms and biotic factors that share its environment.[70] One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic bacterium in a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna. For any species, behaviors can be co-operative, competitive, parasitic, or symbiotic. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem.\u000a\u000aEcological systems are studied at several different levels, from individuals and populations to ecosystems and the biosphere. The term population biology is often used interchangeably with population ecology, although population biology is more frequently used when studying diseases, viruses, and microbes, while population ecology is more commonly used when studying plants and animals. Ecology draws on many subdisciplines.\u000a\u000aEthology studies animal behavior (particularly that of social animals such as primates and canids), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology. Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of natural selection. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose book, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, influenced many ethologists to come.[71]\u000a\u000aBiogeography studies the spatial distribution of organisms on the Earth, focusing on topics like plate tectonics, climate change, dispersal and migration, and cladistics.\u000a\u000aDespite the profound advances made over recent decades in our understanding of life\u2019s fundamental processes, some basic problems have remained unresolved. For example, one of the major unresolved problems in biology is the primary adaptive function of sex, and particularly its key processes in eukaryotes, meiosis and homologous recombination. One view is that sex evolved primarily as an adaptation for increasing genetic diversity (see references e.g.[72][73]). An alternative view is that sex is an adaptation for promoting accurate DNA repair in germ-line DNA, and that increased genetic diversity is primarily a byproduct that may be useful in the long run.[74][75] (See also Evolution of sexual reproduction).\u000a\u000aAnother basic unresolved problem in biology is the biologic basis of aging. At present, there is no consensus view on the underlying cause of aging. Various competing theories are outlined in Ageing#Theories.\u000a\u000aThese are the main branches of biology:[76][77]

VThe atom is a basic unit of matter that consists of a dense central nucleus surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged electrons. The atomic nucleus contains a mix of positively charged protons and electrically neutral neutrons (except in the case of hydrogen-1, which is the only stable nuclide with no neutrons). The electrons of an atom are bound to the nucleus by the electromagnetic force. Likewise, a group of atoms can remain bound to each other by chemical bonds based on the same force, forming a molecule. An atom containing an equal number of protons and electrons is electrically neutral, otherwise it is positively or negatively charged and is known as an ion. An atom is classified according to the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus: the number of protons determines the chemical element, and the number of neutrons determines the isotope of the element.[1]\u000a\u000aChemical atoms, which in science now carry the simple name of "atom," are minuscule objects with diameters of a few tenths of a nanometer and tiny masses proportional to the volume implied by these dimensions. Atoms can only be observed individually using special instruments such as the scanning tunneling microscope. Over 99.94% of an atom's mass is concentrated in the nucleus,[note 1] with protons and neutrons having roughly equal mass. Each element has at least one isotope with an unstable nucleus that can undergo radioactive decay. This can result in a transmutation that changes the number of protons or neutrons in a nucleus.[2] Electrons that are bound to atoms possess a set of stable energy levels, or orbitals, and can undergo transitions between them by absorbing or emitting photons that match the energy differences between the levels. The electrons determine the chemical properties of an element, and strongly influence an atom's magnetic properties. The principles of quantum mechanics have been successfully used to model the observed properties of the atom.\u000a\u000aThe name atom comes from the Greek \u1f04\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 (atomos, "indivisible") from \u1f00- (a-, "not") and \u03c4\u03ad\u03bc\u03bd\u03c9 (temn\u014d, "I cut"),[3] which means uncuttable, or indivisible, something that cannot be divided further.[4]\u000a\u000aThe idea that matter is made up of discrete units is a very old one, appearing in many ancient cultures such as Greece and India. The word "atom", in fact, was coined by ancient Greek philosophers. However, these ideas were founded in philosophical and theological reasoning rather than evidence and experimentation. As a result, their views on what atoms look like and how they behave were very incorrect. They also couldn't convince everybody, so atomism was but one of a number of competing theories on the nature of matter. It wasn't until the 19th century that the idea was embraced and refined by scientists, when the blossoming science of chemistry produced discoveries that only the concept of atoms could explain.\u000a\u000aIn the early 1800s, John Dalton used the concept of atoms to explain why elements always react in ratios of small whole numbers (the law of multiple proportions). For instance: there are two types of tin oxide\u2014one is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen and the other is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (tin(II) oxide and tin dioxide respectively). This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2. This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete units\u2014in other words, atoms. In the case of tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.[5]\u000a\u000aDalton also believed atomic theory could explain why water absorbs different gases in different proportions. For example, he found that water absorbs carbon dioxide far better than it absorbs nitrogen.[6] Dalton hypothesized this was due to the differences in mass and complexity of the gases' respective particles. Indeed, carbon dioxide molecules (CO ) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N ).\u000a\u000aIn 1827, botanist Robert Brown used a microscope to look at dust grains floating in water and discovered that they moved about erratically, a phenomenon that became known as "Brownian motion". This was thought to be caused by water molecules knocking the grains about. In 1905 Albert Einstein produced the first mathematical analysis of the motion.[7][9] French physicist Jean Perrin used Einstein's work to experimentally determine the mass and dimensions of atoms, thereby conclusively verifying Dalton's atomic theory.[10]\u000a\u000aThe physicist J. J. Thomson, through his work on cathode rays in 1897, discovered the electron, and concluded that they were a component of every atom. Thus he overturned the belief that atoms are the indivisible, ultimate particles of matter.[11] Thomson postulated that the low mass, negatively charged electrons were distributed throughout the atom in a uniform sea of positive charge. This became known as the plum pudding model.\u000a\u000aIn 1909, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, under the direction of Ernest Rutherford, bombarded a metal foil with alpha particles to observe how they scattered. Going by Thomson's plum pudding model, all the alpha particles should have passed straight through the foil with little deflection, because the positive charge of its atoms should have been too dilute to affect them much. They instead observed a small fraction of alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90°. To explain this, Rutherford proposed that each atom has a nucleus where the positive charge and most of the mass are concentrated, and these were what were deflecting those alpha particles so strongly.[12]\u000a\u000aWhile experimenting with the products of radioactive decay, in 1913 radiochemist Frederick Soddy discovered that there appeared to be more than one type of atom at each position on the periodic table.[13] The term isotope was coined by Margaret Todd as a suitable name for different atoms that belong to the same element. J.J. Thomson created a technique for separating atom types through his work on ionized gases, which subsequently led to the discovery of stable isotopes.[14]\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, in 1913, physicist Niels Bohr suggested that the electrons were confined into clearly defined, quantized orbits, and could jump between these, but could not freely spiral inward or outward in intermediate states like satellites orbiting a planet.[15] An electron must absorb or emit specific amounts of energy to transition between these fixed orbits. This explained why the electrons don't spiral down into the nucleus, and why elements absorb and emit light in discrete spectra.[16]\u000a\u000aLater in the same year Henry Moseley provided additional experimental evidence in favor of Niels Bohr's theory. These results refined Ernest Rutherford's and Antonius Van den Broek's model, which proposed that the atom contains in its nucleus a number of positive nuclear charges that is equal to its (atomic) number in the periodic table. Until these experiments, atomic number was not known to be a physical and experimental quantity. That it is equal to the atomic nuclear charge remains the accepted atomic model today.\u000a\u000aChemical bonds between atoms were now explained, by Gilbert Newton Lewis in 1916, as the interactions between their constituent electrons.[18] As the chemical properties of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law, in 1919 the American chemist Irving Langmuir suggested that this could be explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of electron shells about the nucleus.[20]\u000a\u000aThe Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment of 1922 provided further evidence of the quantum nature of the atom. When a beam of silver atoms was passed through a specially shaped magnetic field, the beam was split based on the direction of an atom's angular momentum, or spin. As this direction is random, the beam could be expected to spread into a line. Instead, the beam was split into two parts, depending on whether the atomic spin was oriented up or down.[21]\u000a\u000aIn 1924, Louis de Broglie proposed that all particles behave to an extent like waves. In 1926, Erwin Schrödinger used this idea to develop a mathematical model of the atom that described the electrons as three-dimensional waveforms rather than point particles. A consequence of using waveforms to describe particles is that it is mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the position and momentum of a particle at the same time; this became known as the uncertainty principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1926. In this concept, for a given accuracy in measuring a position one could only obtain a range of probable values for momentum, and vice versa. This model was able to explain observations of atomic behavior that previous models could not, such as certain structural and spectral patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen. Thus, the planetary model of the atom was discarded in favor of one that described atomic orbital zones around the nucleus where a given electron is most likely to be observed.[22][23]\u000a\u000aThe development of the mass spectrometer allowed the exact mass of atoms to be measured. The device uses a magnet to bend the trajectory of a beam of ions, and the amount of deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom's mass to its charge. The chemist Francis William Aston used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses. The atomic mass of these isotopes varied by integer amounts, called the whole number rule.[24] The explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the neutron, a neutral-charged particle with a mass similar to the proton, by the physicist James Chadwick in 1932. Isotopes were then explained as elements with the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons within the nucleus.[25]\u000a\u000aIn 1938, the German chemist Otto Hahn, a student of Rutherford, directed neutrons onto uranium atoms expecting to get transuranium elements. Instead, his chemical experiments showed barium as a product.[26] A year later, Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch verified that Hahn's result were the first experimental nuclear fission.[27][28] In 1944, Hahn received the Nobel prize in chemistry. Despite Hahn's efforts, the contributions of Meitner and Frisch were not recognized.[29]\u000a\u000aIn the 1950s, the development of improved particle accelerators and particle detectors allowed scientists to study the impacts of atoms moving at high energies.[30] Neutrons and protons were found to be hadrons, or composites of smaller particles called quarks. The standard model of particle physics was developed that so far has successfully explained the properties of the nucleus in terms of these sub-atomic particles and the forces that govern their interactions.[31]\u000a\u000aThough the word atom originally denoted a particle that cannot be cut into smaller particles, in modern scientific usage the atom is composed of various subatomic particles. The constituent particles of an atom are the electron, the proton and the neutron; all three are fermions. However, the hydrogen-1 atom has no neutrons and the hydron ion has no electrons.\u000a\u000aThe electron is by far the least massive of these particles at 9.11×10\u221231 kg, with a negative electrical charge and a size that is too small to be measured using available techniques. It is the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured. Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges. If an atom have more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, then is become respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole; a charged atom is called ion. Electrons are known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to J.J. Thomson; see history of subatomic physics for details.\u000a\u000aProtons have a positive charge and a mass 1,836 times that of the electron, at 1.6726×10\u221227 kg. The number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number. Ernest Rutherford (1919) observed that nitrogen under alpha-particle bombardment ejects what appeared to be hydrogen nuclei. By 1920 he had accepted that the hydrogen nucleus is a distinct particle within the atom and named it proton.\u000a\u000aNeutrons have no electrical charge and have a free mass of 1,839 times the mass of the electron, or 1.6929×10\u221227 kg, the heaviest of the three constituent particles, but it can be reduced by the nuclear binding energy. Neutrons and protons (collectively known as nucleons) have comparable dimensions\u2014on the order of 2.5×10\u221215 m\u2014although the 'surface' of these particles is not sharply defined. The neutron was discovered in 1932 by the English physicist James Chadwick.\u000a\u000aIn the Standard Model of physics, electrons are truly elementary particles with no internal structure. However, both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of elementary particles called quarks. There are two types of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge. Protons are composed of two up quarks (each with charge +2\u2044 ) and one down quark (with a charge of \u22121\u2044 ). Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks. This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles.[35][36]\u000a\u000aThe quarks are held together by the strong interaction (or strong force), which is mediated by gluons. The protons and neutrons, in turn, are held to each other in the nucleus by the nuclear force, which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range-properties (see the article on the nuclear force for more). The gluon is a member of the family of gauge bosons, which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces.[35][36]\u000a\u000aAll the bound protons and neutrons in an atom make up a tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07 3\u221aA fm, where A is the total number of nucleons. This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105 fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.\u000a\u000aAtoms of the same element have the same number of protons, called the atomic number. Within a single element, the number of neutrons may vary, determining the isotope of that element. The total number of protons and neutrons determine the nuclide. The number of neutrons relative to the protons determines the stability of the nucleus, with certain isotopes undergoing radioactive decay.[39]\u000a\u000aThe proton, the electron, and the neutron are classified as fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle which prohibits identical fermions, such as multiple protons, from occupying the same quantum state at the same time. Thus, every proton in the nucleus must occupy a quantum state different from all other protons, and the same applies to all neutrons of the nucleus and to all electrons of the electron cloud. However, a proton and a neutron are allowed to occupy the same quantum state.[40]\u000a\u000aFor atoms with low atomic numbers, a nucleus that has more neutrons than protons tends to drop to a lower energy state through radioactive decay so that the neutron-proton ratio is closer to one. However, as the atomic number increases, a higher proportion of neutrons is required to offset the mutual repulsion of the protons. Thus, there are no stable nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers above atomic number Z = 20 (calcium) and as Z increases, the neutron-proton ratio of stable isotopes increases.[40] The stable isotope with the highest proton-neutron ration is lead-208 (about 1.5).\u000a\u000aThe number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus can be modified, although this can require very high energies because of the strong force. Nuclear fusion occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, at the core of the Sun protons require energies of 3\u201310 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion\u2014the coulomb barrier\u2014and fuse together into a single nucleus.[41] Nuclear fission is the opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei\u2014usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.[42][43]\u000a\u000aIf the mass of the nucleus following a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a gamma ray, or the kinetic energy of a beta particle), as described by Albert Einstein's mass\u2013energy equivalence formula, E = mc2, where m is the mass loss and c is the speed of light. This deficit is part of the binding energy of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.\u000a\u000aThe fusion of two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickel\u2014a total nucleon number of about 60\u2014is usually an exothermic process that releases more energy than is required to bring them together.[45] It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in stars a self-sustaining reaction. For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per nucleon in the nucleus begins to decrease. That means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about 26, and atomic masses higher than about 60, is an endothermic process. These more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium of a star.[40]\u000a\u000aThe electrons in an atom are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force. This force binds the electrons inside an electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound near the center of the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.\u000a\u000aElectrons, like other particles, have properties of both a particle and a wave. The electron cloud is a region inside the potential well where each electron forms a type of three-dimensional standing wave\u2014a wave form that does not move relative to the nucleus. This behavior is defined by an atomic orbital, a mathematical function that characterises the probability that an electron appears to be at a particular location when its position is measured.[46] Only a discrete (or quantized) set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus, as other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into a more stable form.[47] Orbitals can have one or more ring or node structures, and they differ from each other in size, shape and orientation.[48]\u000a\u000aEach atomic orbital corresponds to a particular energy level of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through spontaneous emission, an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by the differences in the energies of the quantum states, are responsible for atomic spectral lines.[47]\u000a\u000aThe amount of energy needed to remove or add an electron\u2014the electron binding energy\u2014is far less than the binding energy of nucleons. For example, it requires only 13.6 eV to strip a ground-state electron from a hydrogen atom,[49] compared to 2.23 million eV for splitting a deuterium nucleus.[50] Atoms are electrically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called ions. Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms. By this mechanism, atoms are able to bond into molecules and other types of chemical compounds like ionic and covalent network crystals.\u000a\u000aBy definition, any two atoms with an identical number of protons in their nuclei belong to the same chemical element. Atoms with equal numbers of protons but a different number of neutrons are different isotopes of the same element. For example, all hydrogen atoms admit exactly one proton, but isotopes exist with no neutrons (hydrogen-1, by far the most common form,[52] also called protium), one neutron (deuterium), two neutrons (tritium) and more than two neutrons. The known elements form a set of atomic numbers, from the single proton element hydrogen up to the 118-proton element ununoctium.[53] All known isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than 82 are radioactive.[55]\u000a\u000aAbout 339 nuclides occur naturally on Earth,[56] of which 254 (about 75%) have not been observed to decay, and are referred to as "stable isotopes". However, only 90 of these nuclides are stable to all decay, even in theory. Another 164 (bringing the total to 254) have not been observed to decay, even though in theory it is energetically possible. These are also formally classified as "stable". An additional 34 radioactive nuclides have half-lives longer than 80 million years, and are long-lived enough to be present from the birth of the solar system. This collection of 288 nuclides are known as primordial nuclides. Finally, an additional 51 short-lived nuclides are known to occur naturally, as daughter products of primordial nuclide decay (such as radium from uranium), or else as products of natural energetic processes on Earth, such as cosmic ray bombardment (for example, carbon-14).[57][note 2]\u000a\u000aFor 80 of the chemical elements, at least one stable isotope exists. As a rule, there is only a handful of stable isotopes for each of these elements, the average being 3.2 stable isotopes per element. Twenty-six elements have only a single stable isotope, while the largest number of stable isotopes observed for any element is ten, for the element tin. Elements 43, 61, and all elements numbered 83 or higher have no stable isotopes.[58][page needed]\u000a\u000aStability of isotopes is affected by the ratio of protons to neutrons, and also by the presence of certain "magic numbers" of neutrons or protons that represent closed and filled quantum shells. These quantum shells correspond to a set of energy levels within the shell model of the nucleus; filled shells, such as the filled shell of 50 protons for tin, confers unusual stability on the nuclide. Of the 254 known stable nuclides, only four have both an odd number of protons and odd number of neutrons: hydrogen-2 (deuterium), lithium-6, boron-10 and nitrogen-14. Also, only four naturally occurring, radioactive odd-odd nuclides have a half-life over a billion years: potassium-40, vanadium-50, lanthanum-138 and tantalum-180m. Most odd-odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to beta decay, because the decay products are even-even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to nuclear pairing effects.[58][page needed]\u000a\u000aThe large majority of an atom's mass comes from the protons and neutrons that make it up. The total number of these particles (called "nucleons") in a given atom is called the mass number. The mass number is a simple whole number, and has units of "nucleons." An example of use of a mass number is "carbon-12," which has 12 nucleons (six protons and six neutrons).\u000a\u000aThe actual mass of an atom at rest is often expressed using the unified atomic mass unit (u), which is also called a dalton (Da). This unit is defined as a twelfth of the mass of a free neutral atom of carbon-12, which is approximately 1.66×10\u221227 kg.[59] Hydrogen-1, the lightest isotope of hydrogen and the atom with the lowest mass, has an atomic weight of 1.007825 u.[60] The value of this number is called the atomic mass. A given atom has an atomic mass approximately equal (within 1%) to its mass number times the mass of the atomic mass unit. However, this number will not be an exact whole number except in the case of carbon-12 (see below).[61] The heaviest stable atom is lead-208, with a mass of 207.9766521 u.[62]\u000a\u000aAs even the most massive atoms are far too light to work with directly, chemists instead use the unit of moles. One mole of atoms of any element always has the same number of atoms (about 6.022×1023). This number was chosen so that if an element has an atomic mass of 1 u, a mole of atoms of that element has a mass close to one gram. Because of the definition of the unified atomic mass unit, each carbon-12 atom has an atomic mass of exactly 12 u, and so a mole of carbon-12 atoms weighs exactly 0.012 kg.[59][page needed]\u000a\u000aAtoms lack a well-defined outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually described in terms of an atomic radius. This is a measure of the distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus.[citation needed] However, this assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or free space. Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a chemical bond. The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms (coordination number) and a quantum mechanical property known as spin.[63] On the periodic table of the elements, atom size tends to increase when moving down columns, but decrease when moving across rows (left to right).[64] Consequently, the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32 pm, while one of the largest is caesium at 225 pm.[65]\u000a\u000aWhen subjected to external fields, like an electrical field, the shape of an atom may deviate from spherical symmetry. The deformation depends on the field magnitude and the orbital type of outer shell electrons, as shown by group-theoretical considerations. Aspherical deviations might be elicited for instance in crystals, where large crystal-electrical fields may occur at low-symmetry lattice sites.[66] Significant ellipsoidal deformations have recently been shown to occur for sulfur ions in pyrite-type compounds.[67]\u000a\u000aAtomic dimensions are thousands of times smaller than the wavelengths of light (400\u2013700 nm) so they can not be viewed using an optical microscope. However, individual atoms can be observed using a scanning tunneling microscope. To visualize the minuteness of the atom, consider that a typical human hair is about 1 million carbon atoms in width.[68] A single drop of water contains about 2 sextillion (2×1021) atoms of oxygen, and twice the number of hydrogen atoms.[69] A single carat diamond with a mass of 2×10\u22124 kg contains about 10 sextillion (1022) atoms of carbon.[note 3] If an apple were magnified to the size of the Earth, then the atoms in the apple would be approximately the size of the original apple.\u000a\u000aEvery element has one or more isotopes that have unstable nuclei that are subject to radioactive decay, causing the nucleus to emit particles or electromagnetic radiation. Radioactivity can occur when the radius of a nucleus is large compared with the radius of the strong force, which only acts over distances on the order of 1 fm.[71]\u000a\u000aThe most common forms of radioactive decay are:[73]\u000a\u000aOther more rare types of radioactive decay include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of nucleons from a nucleus, or more than one beta particle. An analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in a different way, is internal conversion\u2014 a process that produces high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, followed by production of high-energy photons that are not gamma rays. A few large nuclei explode into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons, in a decay called spontaneous nuclear fission.\u000a\u000aEach radioactive isotope has a characteristic decay time period\u2014the half-life\u2014that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an exponential decay process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth.[71]\u000a\u000aElementary particles possess an intrinsic quantum mechanical property known as spin. This is analogous to the angular momentum of an object that is spinning around its center of mass, although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point-like and cannot be said to be rotating. Spin is measured in units of the reduced Planck constant (\u0127), with electrons, protons and neutrons all having spin ½ \u0127, or "spin-½". In an atom, electrons in motion around the nucleus possess orbital angular momentum in addition to their spin, while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin.[74]\u000a\u000aThe magnetic field produced by an atom\u2014its magnetic moment\u2014is determined by these various forms of angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a magnetic field. However, the most dominant contribution comes from spin. Due to the nature of electrons to obey the Pauli exclusion principle, in which no two electrons may be found in the same quantum state, bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.[75]\u000a\u000aIn ferromagnetic elements such as iron, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a process known as an exchange interaction. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. Paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up in the presence of a field.[75][76]\u000a\u000aThe nucleus of an atom can also have a net spin. Normally these nuclei are aligned in random directions because of thermal equilibrium. However, for certain elements (such as xenon-129) it is possible to polarize a significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction\u2014a condition called hyperpolarization. This has important applications in magnetic resonance imaging.[77]\u000a\u000aThe potential energy of an electron in an atom is negative, its dependence of its position reaches the minimum (the most absolute value) inside the nucleus, and vanishes when the distance from the nucleus goes to infinity, roughly in an inverse proportion to the distance. In the quantum-mechanical model, a bound electron can only occupy a set of states centered on the nucleus, and each state corresponds to a specific energy level; see time-independent Schrödinger equation for theoretical explanation. An energy level can be measured by the amount of energy needed to unbind the electron from the atom, and is usually given in units of electronvolts (eV). The lowest energy state of a bound electron is called the ground state, i.e. stationary state, while an electron transition to a higher level results in an excited state.[79] The electron's energy raises when n increases because the (average) distance to the nucleus increases. Dependence of the energy on \u2113 is caused not by electrostatic potential of the nucleus, but by interaction between electrons.\u000a\u000aFor an electron to transition between two different states, e.g. grounded state to first excited level (ionization), it must absorb or emit a photon at an energy matching the difference in the potential energy of those levels, according to Niels Bohr model, what can be precisely calculated by the Schrödinger equation. Electrons jump between orbitals in a particle-like fashion. For example, if a single photon strikes the electrons, only a single electron changes states in response to the photon; see Electron properties.\u000a\u000aThe energy of an emitted photon is proportional to its frequency, so these specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the electromagnetic spectrum.[80] Each element has a characteristic spectrum that can depend on the nuclear charge, subshells filled by electrons, the electromagnetic interactions between the electrons and other factors.[81]\u000a\u000aWhen a continuous spectrum of energy is passed through a gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level. Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels. Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark absorption bands in the energy output. (An observer viewing the atoms from a view that does not include the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of emission lines from the photons emitted by the atoms.) Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of atomic spectral lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.[82]\u000a\u000aClose examination of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin\u2013orbit coupling, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron.[83] When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This is caused by the interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines.[84] The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the Stark effect.\u000a\u000aIf a bound electron is in an excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause stimulated emission of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching the energy of the interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make lasers, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.[86]\u000a\u000aThe outermost electron shell of an atom in its uncombined state is known as the valence shell, and the electrons in that shell are called valence electrons. The number of valence electrons determines the bonding behavior with other atoms. Atoms tend to chemically react with each other in a manner that fills (or empties) their outer valence shells.[87] For example, a transfer of a single electron between atoms is a useful approximation for bonds that form between atoms with one-electron more than a filled shell, and others that are one-electron short of a full shell, such as occurs in the compound sodium chloride and other chemical ionic salts. However, many elements display multiple valences, or tendencies to share differing numbers of electrons in different compounds. Thus, chemical bonding between these elements takes many forms of electron-sharing that are more than simple electron transfers. Examples include the element carbon and the organic compounds.[88]\u000a\u000aThe chemical elements are often displayed in a periodic table that is laid out to display recurring chemical properties, and elements with the same number of valence electrons form a group that is aligned in the same column of the table. (The horizontal rows correspond to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons.) The elements at the far right of the table have their outer shell completely filled with electrons, which results in chemically inert elements known as the noble gases.[89][90]\u000a\u000aQuantities of atoms are found in different states of matter that depend on the physical conditions, such as temperature and pressure. By varying the conditions, materials can transition between solids, liquids, gases and plasmas. Within a state, a material can also exist in different allotropes. An example of this is solid carbon, which can exist as graphite or diamond.[92] Gaseous allotropes exist as well, such as dioxygen and ozone.\u000a\u000aAt temperatures close to absolute zero, atoms can form a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate, at which point quantum mechanical effects, which are normally only observed at the atomic scale, become apparent on a macroscopic scale.[94] This super-cooled collection of atoms then behaves as a single super atom, which may allow fundamental checks of quantum mechanical behavior.[95]\u000a\u000aThe scanning tunneling microscope is a device for viewing surfaces at the atomic level. It uses the quantum tunneling phenomenon, which allows particles to pass through a barrier that would normally be insurmountable. Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes, on each of which is an adsorbed atom, providing a tunneling-current density that can be measured. Scanning one atom (taken as the tip) as it moves past the other (the sample) permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral separation for a constant current. The calculation shows the extent to which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are visible. It confirms that for low bias, the microscope images the space-averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels\u2014the Fermi level local density of states.[96][97]\u000a\u000aAn atom can be ionized by removing one of its electrons. The electric charge causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a magnetic field. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field is determined by the mass of the atom. The mass spectrometer uses this principle to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.[98]\u000a\u000aA more area-selective method is electron energy loss spectroscopy, which measures the energy loss of an electron beam within a transmission electron microscope when it interacts with a portion of a sample. The atom-probe tomograph has sub-nanometer resolution in 3-D and can chemically identify individual atoms using time-of-flight mass spectrometry.[99]\u000a\u000aSpectra of excited states can be used to analyze the atomic composition of distant stars. Specific light wavelengths contained in the observed light from stars can be separated out and related to the quantized transitions in free gas atoms. These colors can be replicated using a gas-discharge lamp containing the same element.[100] Helium was discovered in this way in the spectrum of the Sun 23 years before it was found on Earth.[101]\u000a\u000aAtoms form about 4% of the total energy density of the observable Universe, with an average density of about 0.25 atoms/m3.[102] Within a galaxy such as the Milky Way, atoms have a much higher concentration, with the density of matter in the interstellar medium (ISM) ranging from 105 to 109 atoms/m3. The Sun is believed to be inside the Local Bubble, a region of highly ionized gas, so the density in the solar neighborhood is only about 103 atoms/m3.[104] Stars form from dense clouds in the ISM, and the evolutionary processes of stars result in the steady enrichment of the ISM with elements more massive than hydrogen and helium. Up to 95% of the Milky Way's atoms are concentrated inside stars and the total mass of atoms forms about 10% of the mass of the galaxy. (The remainder of the mass is an unknown dark matter.)[106]\u000a\u000aElectrons are thought to exist in the Universe since early stages of the Big Bang. Atomic nuclei forms in nucleosynthesis reactions. In about three minutes Big Bang nucleosynthesis produced most of the helium, lithium, and deuterium in the Universe, and perhaps some of the beryllium and boron.[107][108][109]\u000a\u000aUbiquitousness and stability of atoms relies on their binding energy, which means that an atom has a lower energy than an unbound system of the nucleus and electrons. Where the temperature is much higher than ionization potential, the matter exists in the form of plasma \u2013 a gas of positively-charged ions (possibly, bare nuclei) and electrons. When the temperature drops below the ionization potential, atoms become statistically favorable. Atoms (complete with bound electrons) became to dominate over charged particles 380,000 years after the Big Bang\u2014an epoch called recombination, when the expanding Universe cooled enough to allow electrons to become attached to nuclei.[110]\u000a\u000aSince the Big Bang, which produced no carbon or heavier elements, atomic nuclei have been combined in stars through the process of nuclear fusion to produce more of the element helium, and (via the triple alpha process) the sequence of elements from carbon up to iron;[111] see stellar nucleosynthesis for details.\u000a\u000aIsotopes such as lithium-6, as well as some beryllium and boron are generated in space through cosmic ray spallation.[112] This occurs when a high-energy proton strikes an atomic nucleus, causing large numbers of nucleons to be ejected.\u000a\u000aElements heavier than iron were produced in supernovae through the r-process and in AGB stars through the s-process, both of which involve the capture of neutrons by atomic nuclei.[113] Elements such as lead formed largely through the radioactive decay of heavier elements.[114]\u000a\u000aMost of the atoms that make up the Earth and its inhabitants were present in their current form in the nebula that collapsed out of a molecular cloud to form the Solar System. The rest are the result of radioactive decay, and their relative proportion can be used to determine the age of the Earth through radiometric dating.[116] Most of the helium in the crust of the Earth (about 99% of the helium from gas wells, as shown by its lower abundance of helium-3) is a product of alpha decay.[117]\u000a\u000aThere are a few trace atoms on Earth that were not present at the beginning (i.e., not "primordial"), nor are results of radioactive decay. Carbon-14 is continuously generated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.[118] Some atoms on Earth have been artificially generated either deliberately or as by-products of nuclear reactors or explosions.[119][120] Of the transuranic elements\u2014those with atomic numbers greater than 92\u2014only plutonium and neptunium occur naturally on Earth.[121][122] Transuranic elements have radioactive lifetimes shorter than the current age of the Earth and thus identifiable quantities of these elements have long since decayed, with the exception of traces of plutonium-244 possibly deposited by cosmic dust. Natural deposits of plutonium and neptunium are produced by neutron capture in uranium ore.[125]\u000a\u000aThe Earth contains approximately 1.33×1050 atoms.[126] Although small numbers of independent atoms of noble gases exist, such as argon, neon, and helium, 99% of the atmosphere is bound in the form of molecules, including carbon dioxide and diatomic oxygen and nitrogen. At the surface of the Earth, an overwhelming majority of atoms combine to form various compounds, including water, salt, silicates and oxides. Atoms can also combine to create materials that do not consist of discrete molecules, including crystals and liquid or solid metals.[127][128] This atomic matter forms networked arrangements that lack the particular type of small-scale interrupted order associated with molecular matter.\u000a\u000aWhile isotopes with atomic numbers higher than lead (82) are known to be radioactive, an "island of stability" has been proposed for some elements with atomic numbers above 103. These superheavy elements may have a nucleus that is relatively stable against radioactive decay.[130] The most likely candidate for a stable superheavy atom, unbihexium, has 126 protons and 184 neutrons.[131]\u000a\u000aEach particle of matter has a corresponding antimatter particle with the opposite electrical charge. Thus, the positron is a positively charged antielectron and the antiproton is a negatively charged equivalent of a proton. When a matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet, they annihilate each other. Because of this, along with an imbalance between the number of matter and antimatter particles, the latter are rare in the universe. The first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood, although theories of baryogenesis may offer an explanation. As a result, no antimatter atoms have been discovered in nature.[132][133] However, in 1996 the antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom (antihydrogen) was synthesized at the CERN laboratory in Geneva.[134][135]\u000a\u000aOther exotic atoms have been created by replacing one of the protons, neutrons or electrons with other particles that have the same charge. For example, an electron can be replaced by a more massive muon, forming a muonic atom. These types of atoms can be used to test the fundamental predictions of physics.[136][137][138]

Vdog (Canis lupus familiaris), domestic mammal of the family Canidae (order Carnivora). It is a subspecies of the gray wolf (C. lupus) and is related to foxes and jackals. The dog is one of the two most ubiquitous and popular domestic animals in the world (the cat is the other). For more than 12,000 years it has lived with humans as a hunting companion, protector, object of scorn or adoration, and friend.\u000a\u000aThe dog evolved from the gray wolf into more than 400 distinct breeds. Human beings have played a major role in creating dogs that fulfill distinct societal needs. Through the most rudimentary form of genetic engineering, dogs were bred to accentuate instincts that were evident from their earliest encounters with humans. Although details about the evolution of dogs are uncertain, the first dogs were hunters with keen senses of sight and smell. Humans developed these instincts and created new breeds as need or desire arose.\u000a\u000aDogs are regarded differently in different parts of the world. Characteristics of loyalty, friendship, protectiveness, and affection have earned dogs an important position in Western society, and in the United States and Europe the care and feeding of dogs has become a multibillion-dollar business. Western civilization has given the relationship between human and dog great importance, but, in some of the developing nations and in many areas of Asia, dogs are not held in the same esteem. In some areas of the world, dogs are used as guards or beasts of burden or even for food, whereas in the United States and Europe dogs are protected and admired. In ancient Egypt during the days of the pharaohs, dogs were considered to be sacred.\u000a\u000aDogs have played an important role in the history of human civilization and were among the first domesticated animals. They were important in hunter-gatherer societies as hunting allies and bodyguards against predators. When livestock were domesticated about 7,000 to 9,000 years ago, dogs served as herders and guardians of sheep, goats, and cattle. Although many still serve in these capacities, dogs are increasingly used for social purposes and companionship. Today dogs are employed as guides for the blind and disabled or for police work. Dogs are even used in therapy in nursing homes and hospitals to encourage patients toward recovery. Humans have bred a wide range of different dogs adapted to serve a variety of functions. This has been enhanced by improvements in veterinary care and animal husbandry.

VThe United States of America (USA or U.S.A.), commonly referred to as the United States (US or U.S.), America, and sometimes the States, is a federal republic[17][18] consisting of 50 states and a federal district. The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.79 million square miles (9.83 million km2) in total and with around 318 million people, the United States is the third or fourth-largest country by total area and third largest by population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries.[19] The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.\u000a\u000aPaleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago,[20] with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire.[21][22] The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.\u000a\u000aDriven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century.[23] This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states.[23] The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country.[24] By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean,[25] and its economy was the world's largest.[26] The Spanish\u2013American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.\u000a\u000aThe United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion\u201423% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity.[6][27] The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity,[28] with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest in 2010.[6] While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers.[29] The U.S. has the highest mean and fourth-highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest gross average wage,[30][31][32] though it has the fourth most unequal income distribution,[33][34] with roughly 15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S. Census.[35] The country accounts for 36.6% of global military spending,[36] being the world's foremost economic and military power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.[37][38][39][40][41]\u000a\u000aIn 1507, the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller produced a world map on which he named the lands of the Western Hemisphere "America" after the Italian explorer and cartographer Amerigo Vespucci (Latin: Americus Vespucius).[42] The first documentary evidence of the phrase "United States of America" is from a letter dated January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, Esq., George Washington's aide-de-camp and Muster-Master General of the Continental Army. Addressed to Lt. Col. Joseph Reed, Moylan expressed his wish to carry the "full and ample powers of the United States of America" to Spain to assist in the revolutionary war effort.[43]\u000a\u000aThe first publicly published evidence of the phrase "United States of America" was in an anonymously written essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia, on April 6, 1776.[44][45] In June 1776, Thomas Jefferson included the phrase "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA" in all capitalized letters in the headline of his "original Rough draught" of the Declaration of Independence.[46][47] In the final Fourth of July version of the Declaration, the pertinent section of the title was changed to read, "The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America".[48] In 1777 the Articles of Confederation announced, "The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America'".[49]\u000a\u000aThe short form "United States" is also standard. Other common forms include the "U.S.", the "U.S.A.", and "America". Colloquial names include the "U.S. of A." and, internationally, the "States". "Columbia", a name popular in poetry and songs of the late 1700s,[50] derives its origin from Christopher Columbus; it appears in the name "District of Columbia". In non-English languages, the name is frequently translated as the translation of either the "United States" or "United States of America", and colloquially as "America". In addition, an abbreviation (e.g. USA) is sometimes used.[51]\u000a\u000aThe phrase "United States" was originally treated as plural, a description of a collection of independent states\u2014e.g., "the United States are"\u2014including in the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1865. It became common to treat it as singular, a single unit\u2014e.g., "the United States is"\u2014after the end of the Civil War. The singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained in the idiom "these United States".[52] The difference has been described as more significant than one of usage, but reflecting the difference between a collection of states and a unit.[53]\u000a\u000aThe standard way to refer to a citizen of the United States is as an "American". "United States", "American" and "U.S." are used to refer to the country adjectivally ("American values", "U.S. forces"). "American" is rarely used in English to refer to subjects not connected with the United States.[54]\u000a\u000aThe first North American settlers migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge approximately 15,000 or more years ago.[20][55][56] Some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture, developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level societies. After European explorers and traders made the first contacts, the native population declined due to various reasons, including diseases such as smallpox and measles,[57][58] intermarriage,[59] and violence.[60][61][62]\u000a\u000aIn the early days of colonization many settlers were subject to shortages of food, disease and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their colonial wars.[63] At the same time however many natives and settlers came to depend on each other. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other European wares.[64] Natives taught many settlers where, when and how to cultivate corn, beans and squash in the frontier. European missionaries and others felt it was important to "civilize" the Indians and urged them to concentrate on farming and ranching without depending on hunting and gathering.[65][66]\u000a\u000aAfter Columbus' first voyage to the New World in 1492 other explorers and settlement followed into the Floridas and the American Southwest.[67][68] There were also some French attempts to colonize the east coast, and later more successful settlements along the Mississippi River. Successful English settlement on the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and the Pilgrims' Plymouth Colony in 1620. Early experiments in communal living failed until the introduction of private farm holdings.[69] The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's House of Burgesses created in 1619, and the Mayflower Compact, signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking, established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[70][71]\u000a\u000aMost settlers in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed. Cash crops included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships and by the late colonial period Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply.[72] Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive freed indentured servants pushed further west.[73] Slave cultivation of cash crops began with the Spanish in the 1500s, and was adopted by the English, but life expectancy was much higher in North America because of less disease and better food and treatment, so the numbers of slaves grew rapidly.[74][75][76] Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice.[77][78] But by the turn of the 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.[79]\u000a\u000aWith the 1732 colonization of Georgia, the 13 colonies that would become the United States of America were established.[80] All had local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to the ancient rights of Englishmen and a sense of self-government stimulating support for republicanism.[81] With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly. Relatively small Native American populations were eclipsed.[82] The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty.\u000a\u000aIn the French and Indian War, British forces seized Canada from the French, but the francophone population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans, who were being conquered and displaced, those 13 colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[83] The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert Royal authority.\u000a\u000aThe American Revolutionary War was the first successful colonial war of independence against a European power. Americans had developed an ideology of "republicanism" that held government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures. They demanded their rights as Englishmen, \u201cno taxation without representation\u201d. The British insisted on administering the empire through Parliament, and the conflict escalated into war.[84] The Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, on July 4, 1776, proclaiming that humanity is created equal in their inalienable rights. That date is now celebrated annually as America's Independence Day. In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a weak government that operated until 1789.[85]\u000a\u000aBritain recognized the independence of the United States following their defeat at Yorktown.[86] In the peace treaty of 1783, American sovereignty was recognized from the Atlantic coast west to the Mississippi River. Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution, and it was ratified in state conventions in 1788. The federal government was reorganized into three branches for their checks and balances in 1789. George Washington, who had led the revolutionary army to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.[87]\u000a\u000aAlthough the federal government criminalized the international slave trade in 1808, after 1820 cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it the slave population.[88][89][90] The Second Great Awakening, beginning about 1800, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism,[91] in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations.[92]\u000a\u000aAmericans' eagerness to expand westward prompted a long series of Indian Wars.[93] The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nation's size.[94] The War of 1812, declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism.[95] A series of U.S. military incursions into Florida led Spain to cede it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[96] Expansion was aided by steam power, when steamboats began traveling along America's large water systems, which were connected by new canals, such as the Erie and the I&M; then, even faster railroads began their stretch across the nation's land.[97]\u000a\u000aFrom 1820 to 1850, Jacksonian democracy began a set of reforms which included wider male suffrage, and it led to the rise of the Second Party System of Democrats and Whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854. The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that moved Indians into the west to their own reservations. The U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest Destiny.[98] The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[99] Victory in the Mexican-American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.[100]\u000a\u000aThe California Gold Rush of 1848\u201349 spurred western migration and the creation of additional western states.[101] After the American Civil War, new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers, expanded internal trade and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[102] Over a half-century, the loss of the buffalo was an existential blow to many Plains Indians cultures.[103] In 1869, a new Peace Policy sought to protect Native-Americans from abuses, avoid further warfare, and secure their eventual U.S. citizenship.[104]\u000a\u000aFrom the beginning of the United States, inherent divisions over slavery between the North and the South in American society ultimately led to the American Civil War.[105] Initially states entering the Union alternated slave and free, keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.[106]\u000a\u000aFollowing the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln, the first president from the largely anti-slavery Republican Party, conventions in thirteen states ultimately declared secession and formed the Confederate States of America, while the U.S. federal government maintained secession was illegal.[106] The ensuing war was at first for Union, then after 1863 as casualties mounted and Lincoln delivered his Emancipation Proclamation, a second war aim became abolition of slavery. The war remains the deadliest military conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians.[107]\u000a\u000aFollowing the Union victory in 1865, three amendments to the U.S. Constitution prohibited slavery, made the nearly four million African Americans who had been slaves[108] U.S. citizens, and promised them voting rights. The war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in federal power[109] aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the Southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed slaves.[110] But following the Reconstruction Era, throughout the South Jim Crow laws soon effectively disenfranchised most blacks and some poor whites. Over the subsequent decades, in both the north and south blacks and some whites faced systemic discrimination, including racial segregation and occasional vigilante violence, sparking national movements against these abuses.[110]\u000a\u000aIn the North, urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country's industrialization and transformed its culture.[111] National infrastructure including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the American Old West. The later invention of electric lights and telephones would also impact communication and urban life.[112] The end of the Indian Wars further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation, increasing surpluses for international markets. Mainland expansion was completed by the Alaska Purchase from Russia in 1867. In 1898 the U.S. entered the world stage with important sugar production and strategic facilities acquired in Hawaii. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same year, following the Spanish American War.\u000a\u000aRapid economic development at the end of the 19th century produced many prominent industrialists, and the U.S. economy became the world's largest. Dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[113] This period eventually ended with the beginning of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms in many societal areas, including women's suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer goods, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions.\u000a\u000aThe United States remained neutral at the outbreak of World War I in 1914, though by 1917, it joined the Allies, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers. President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and advocated strongly for the U.S. to join the League of Nations. However, the Senate refused to approve this, and did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles that established the League of Nations.[114]\u000a\u000aIn 1920, the women's rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment granting women's suffrage.[115] The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early television.[116] The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression. After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal, which included the establishment of the Social Security system.[117] The Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.\u000a\u000aThe United States was at first effectively neutral during World War II's early stages but began supplying material to the Allies in March 1941 through the Lend-Lease program. On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, prompting the United States to join the Allies against the Axis powers.[118] Though the nation lost more than 400,000 soldiers,[119] it emerged relatively undamaged from the war with even greater economic and military influence.[120] Allied conferences at Bretton Woods and Yalta outlined a new system of international organizations that placed the United States and Soviet Union at the center of world affairs. As an Allied victory was won in Europe, a 1945 international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became active after the war.[121] The United States developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan; the Japanese surrendered on September 2, ending World War II.[122]\u000a\u000aAfter World War II the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed for power during what is known as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of "containment" toward Soviet bloc expansion. While they engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict. The U.S. often opposed Third World left-wing movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored. American troops fought Communist Chinese and North Korean forces in the Korean War of 1950\u201353. The Soviet Union's 1957 launch of the first artificial satellite and its 1961 launch of the first manned spaceflight initiated a "Space Race" in which the United States became the first to land a man on the moon in 1969.[123] A proxy war was expanded in Southeast Asia with the Vietnam War.\u000a\u000aAt home, the U.S. experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid growth of its population and middle class. Construction of an interstate highway system transformed the nation\u2019s infrastructure over the following decades. Millions moved from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments.[124][125] A growing Civil Rights movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead. A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, sought to end racial discrimination.[126][127][128] Meanwhile, a counterculture movement grew which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war, black nationalism, and the sexual revolution. The launch of a "War on Poverty" expanded entitlement and welfare spending.[129]\u000a\u000aThe 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation. After his election in 1980, President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation with free-market oriented reforms. Following the collapse of détente, he abandoned "containment" and initiated the more aggressive "rollback" strategy towards the USSR.[130][131][132][133][134] After a surge in female labor participation over the previous decade, by 1985 a majority of women age 16 and over were employed.[135] The late 1980s brought a "thaw" in relations with the USSR, and its collapse in 1991 finally ended the Cold War.[136][137][138][139]\u000a\u000aAfter the Cold War, the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history, ending in 2001.[140] Originating in U.S. defense networks, the Internet spread to international academic networks, and then to the public in the 1990s, greatly impacting the global economy, society, and culture.[141] On September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda terrorists struck the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people.[142] In response the United States launched the War on Terror, which includes the ongoing war in Afghanistan and the 2003\u201311 Iraq War.[143][144] In 2008, amid the Great Recession, Barack Obama was elected president, becoming the first African-American to take the office.[145]\u000a\u000aThe land area of the contiguous United States is 2,959,064 square miles (7,663,941 km2). Alaska, separated from the contiguous United States by Canada, is the largest state at 663,268 square miles (1,717,856 km2). Hawaii, occupying an archipelago in the central Pacific, southwest of North America, is 10,931 square miles (28,311 km2) in area.[146]\u000a\u000aThe United States is the world's third or fourth largest nation by total area (land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and just above or below China. The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted and how the total size of the United States is measured: calculations range from 3,676,486 square miles (9,522,055 km2)[147] to 3,717,813 square miles (9,629,091 km2)[148] to 3,794,101 square miles (9,826,676 km2).[4] Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada.[149]\u000a\u000aThe coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to deciduous forests and the rolling hills of the Piedmont. The Appalachian Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest. The Mississippi\u2013Missouri River, the world's fourth longest river system, runs mainly north\u2013south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.\u000a\u000aThe Rocky Mountains, at the western edge of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado. Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and deserts such as the Chihuahua and Mojave. The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast, both ranges reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m). The lowest and highest points in the continental United States are in the state of California, and only about 80 miles (130 km) apart. At 20,320 feet (6,194 m), Alaska's Mount McKinley is the tallest peak in the country and in North America. Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.[150]\u000a\u000aThe United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south. The southern tip of Florida is tropical, as is Hawaii. The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western mountains are alpine. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Extreme weather is not uncommon\u2014the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur within the country, mainly in the Midwest's Tornado Alley.[151]\u000a\u000aThe U.S. ecology is considered "megadiverse": about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[152] The United States is home to more than 400 mammal, 750 bird, and 500 reptile and amphibian species.[153] About 91,000 insect species have been described.[154] The bald eagle is both the national bird and national animal of the United States, and is an enduring symbol of the country itself.[155]\u000a\u000aThere are 58 national parks and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas.[156] Altogether, the government owns 28.8% of the country's land area.[157] Most of this is protected, though some is leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching; 2.4% is used for military purposes.[157][158][159]\u000a\u000aEnvironmental issues have been on the national agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation,[160][161] and international responses to global warming.[162][163] Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970.[164] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[165] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Census Bureau estimates the country's population now to be 318,292,000,[5] including an approximate 11.2 million illegal immigrants.[169] The U.S. population almost quadrupled during the 20th century, from about 76 million in 1900.[170] The third most populous nation in the world, after China and India, the United States is the only major industrialized nation in which large population increases are projected.[171]\u000a\u000aThe United States has a very diverse population\u201431 ancestry groups have more than one million members.[172] German Americans are the largest ethnic group (more than 50 million) - followed by Irish Americans (circa 35 million), Mexican Americans (circa 31 million) and English Americans (circa 27 million).[173][174]\u000a\u000aWhite Americans are the largest racial group; Black Americans are the nation's largest racial minority and third largest ancestry group.[172] Asian Americans are the country's second largest racial minority; the three largest Asian American ethnic groups are Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, and Indian Americans.[172]\u000a\u000aWith a birth rate of 13 per 1,000, 35% below the world average, its population growth rate is positive at 0.9%, significantly higher than those of many developed nations.[175] In fiscal year 2012, over one million immigrants (most of whom entered through family reunification) were granted legal residence.[176] Mexico has been the leading source of new residents since the 1965 Immigration Act. China, India, and the Philippines have been in the top four sending countries every year.[177][178]\u000a\u000aAccording to a survey conducted by the Williams Institute, nine million Americans, or roughly 3.5% of the adult population identify themselves as homosexual, bisexual, or transgender.[179] A 2012 Gallup poll also concluded that 3.5% of adult Americans identified as LGBT. The highest percentage coming from the Disctrict of Columbia (10%), while the lowest state was North Dakota at 1.7%.[180]\u000a\u000aIn 2010, the U.S. population included an estimated 5.2 million people with some American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry (2.9 million exclusively of such ancestry) and 1.2 million with some native Hawaiian or Pacific island ancestry (0.5 million exclusively).[181] The census counted more than 19 million people of "Some Other Race" who were "unable to identify with any" of its five official race categories in 2010.[181]\u000a\u000aThe population growth of Hispanic and Latino Americans (the terms are officially interchangeable) is a major demographic trend. The 50.5 million Americans of Hispanic descent[181] are identified as sharing a distinct "ethnicity" by the Census Bureau; 64% of Hispanic Americans are of Mexican descent.[182] Between 2000 and 2010, the country's Hispanic population increased 43% while the non-Hispanic population rose just 4.9%.[183] Much of this growth is from immigration; in 2007, 12.6% of the U.S. population was foreign-born, with 54% of that figure born in Latin America.[184]\u000a\u000aFertility is also a factor; in 2010 the average Hispanic (of any race) woman gave birth to 2.35 children in her lifetime, compared to 1.97 for non-Hispanic black women and 1.79 for non-Hispanic white women (both below the replacement rate of 2.1).[185] Minorities (as defined by the Census Bureau as all those beside non-Hispanic, non-multiracial whites) constituted 36.3% of the population in 2010,[186] and over 50% of children under age one,[187] and are projected to constitute the majority by 2042.[188] This contradicts the report by the National Vital Statistics Reports, based on the U.S. census data, which concludes that 54% (2,162,406 out of 3,999,386 in 2010) of births were non-Hispanic white.[185]\u000a\u000aAbout 82% of Americans live in urban areas (including suburbs);[4] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[189] In 2008, 273 incorporated places had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four global cities had over two million (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston).[190] There are 52 metropolitan areas with populations greater than one million.[191] Of the 50 fastest-growing metro areas, 47 are in the West or South.[192] The metro areas of Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and Phoenix all grew by more than a million people between 2000 and 2008.[191]\u000a\u000aEnglish (American English) is the de facto national language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws\u2014such as U.S. naturalization requirements\u2014standardize English. In 2010, about 230 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language.[196][197] Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in at least 28 states.[9]\u000a\u000aBoth Hawaiian and English are official languages in Hawaii, by state law.[198] While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French.[199] Other states, such as California, mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents including court forms.[200] Many jurisdictions with large numbers of non-English speakers produce government materials, especially voting information, in the most commonly spoken languages in those jurisdictions.\u000a\u000aSeveral insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan and Chamorro are recognized by American Samoa and Guam, respectively;[citation needed] Carolinian and Chamorro are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands;[citation needed] Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico and is more widely spoken than English there.[201]\u000a\u000aThe First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment. Christianity is by far the most common religion practiced in the U.S., but other religions are followed, too. In a 2013 survey, 56% of Americans said that religion played a "very important role in their lives", a far higher figure than that of any other wealthy nation.[203] In a 2009 Gallup poll 42% of Americans said that they attended church weekly or almost weekly; the figures ranged from a low of 23% in Vermont to a high of 63% in Mississippi.[204] As with other Western countries, the U.S. is becoming less religious. Irreligion is growing rapidly among Americans under 30.[205] Polls show that overall American confidence in organized religion is declining,[206] and that younger Americans in particular are becoming increasingly irreligious.[207]\u000a\u000aAccording to a 2012 survey, 73% of adults identified themselves as Christian,[208] down from 86.4% in 1990.[209] Protestant denominations accounted for 48%, while Roman Catholicism, at 22%, was the largest individual denomination.[208] The total reporting non-Christian religions in 2012 was 6%, up from 4% in 2007.[208] Other religions include Judaism (1.7%), Buddhism (0.7%), Islam (0.6%), Hinduism (0.4%), and Unitarian Universalism (0.3%).[208] The survey also reported that 19.6% of Americans described themselves as agnostic, atheist or simply having no religion, up from 8.2% in 1990.[208][209][210] There are also Baha'i, Sikh, Jain, Shinto, Confucian, Taoist, Druid, Native American, Wiccan, humanist and deist communities.[211]\u000a\u000aProtestantism is the largest group of religions in the United States, with Baptists being the largest Protestant sect, and the Southern Baptist Convention being the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S. About 19 percent of Protestants are Evangelical, while 15 percent are mainline and 8 percent belong to a traditionally Black church. Roman Catholicism in the U.S. has its origin in the Spanish and French colonization of the Americas, and later grew due to Irish, Italian, Polish, German and Hispanic immigration. Rhode Island is the only state where the majority of the population is Catholic. Lutheranism in the U.S. has its origin in immigration from Northern Europe. North and South Dakota are the only states in which a plurality of the population is Lutheran. Utah is the only state where Mormonism is the religion of the majority of the population. Mormonism is also relatively common in parts of Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming.\u000a\u000aThe Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the Southern United States in which socially conservative evangelical Protestantism is a significant part of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation's average. By contrast, religion plays the least important role in New England and in the Western United States.[204]\u000a\u000aIn 2007, 58% of Americans age 18 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 25% had never been married.[212] Women now work mostly outside the home and receive a majority of bachelor's degrees.[213]\u000a\u000aThe U.S. teenage pregnancy rate, 79.8 per 1,000 women, is the highest among OECD nations.[214] Between 2007 and 2010, the highest teenage birth rate was in Mississippi, and the lowest in New Hampshire.[215] Abortion is legal throughout the U.S., owing to Roe v. Wade, a 1973 landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court. While the abortion rate is falling, the abortion ratio of 241 per 1,000 live births and abortion rate of 15 per 1,000 women aged 15\u201344 remain higher than those of most Western nations.[216] In 2011, the average age at first birth was 25.6 and 40.7% of births were to unmarried women.[217] The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated for 2013 at 2.06 births per woman.[218] Adoption in the United States is common and relatively easy from a legal point of view (compared to other Western countries).[219] In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the U.S. accounted for nearly half of the total number of adoptions worldwide.[220] The legal status of same-sex couples adopting varies by jurisdiction.\u000a\u000aSame-sex marriage is legally permitted in 19 U.S. states, 8 Native American Tribal Jurisdictions, and the District of Columbia. Limited recognition has been granted to out-of-state same-sex marriages in Alaska, Colorado,[221] Missouri, Utah, and Ohio.[222] Polygamy is illegal throughout the U.S.[223] Although Cousin marriages are illegal in most states, they are legal in many states, the District of Columbia and some territories. Some states have some restrictions or exceptions for cousin marriages and/or recognize such marriages performed out-of-state.\u000a\u000aThe United States is the world's oldest surviving federation. It is a constitutional republic and representative democracy, "in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law".[224] The government is regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal document.[225] For 2012, the U.S. ranked 21st on the Democracy Index[226] and 19th on the Corruption Perceptions Index.[227]\u000a\u000aIn the American federalist system, citizens are usually subject to three levels of government: federal, state, and local. The local government's duties are commonly split between county and municipal governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of citizens by district. There is no proportional representation at the federal level, and it is very rare at lower levels.\u000a\u000aThe federal government is composed of three branches:\u000a\u000aThe House of Representatives has 435 voting members, each representing a congressional district for a two-year term. House seats are apportioned among the states by population every tenth year. At the 2010 census, seven states had the minimum of one representative, while California, the most populous state, had 53.[231]\u000a\u000aThe Senate has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected at-large to six-year terms; one third of Senate seats are up for election every other year. The president serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice. The president is not elected by direct vote, but by an indirect electoral college system in which the determining votes are apportioned to the states and the District of Columbia.[232] The Supreme Court, led by the Chief Justice of the United States, has nine members, who serve for life.[233]\u000a\u000aThe state governments are structured in roughly similar fashion; Nebraska uniquely has a unicameral legislature.[234] The governor (chief executive) of each state is directly elected. Some state judges and cabinet officers are appointed by the governors of the respective states, while others are elected by popular vote.\u000a\u000aThe original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states. Article One protects the right to the "great writ" of habeas corpus, The Constitution has been amended 27 times;[235] the first ten amendments, which make up the Bill of Rights, and the Fourteenth Amendment form the central basis of Americans' individual rights. All laws and governmental procedures are subject to judicial review and any law ruled by the courts to be in violation of the Constitution is voided. The principle of judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was established by the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison (1803)[236] in a decision handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall.[237]\u000a\u000aThe United States is a federal union of 50 states. The original 13 states were the successors of the 13 colonies that rebelled against British rule. Early in the country's history, three new states were organized on territory separated from the claims of the existing states: Kentucky from Virginia; Tennessee from North Carolina; and Maine from Massachusetts. Most of the other states have been carved from territories obtained through war or purchase by the U.S. government. One set of exceptions includes Vermont, Texas, and Hawaii: each was an independent republic before joining the union. During the American Civil War, West Virginia broke away from Virginia. The most recent state\u2014Hawaii\u2014achieved statehood on August 21, 1959.[238] The states do not have the right to unilaterally secede from the union.\u000a\u000aThe states compose the vast bulk of the U.S. land mass. The District of Columbia is a federal district which contains the capital of the United States, Washington D.C. The United States also possesses five major overseas territories: Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands in the Caribbean; and American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands in the Pacific.[239] Those born in the major territories are birthright U.S. citizens except Samoans. Samoans born in American Samoa are born U.S. nationals, and may become naturalized citizens.[240] American citizens residing in the territories have fundamental constitutional protections and elective self-government, with a territorial Member of Congress, but they do not vote for president as states. Territories have personal and business tax regimes different from that of states.[241]\u000a\u000aThe United States also observes tribal sovereignty of the Native Nations. Though reservations are within state borders, the reservation is a sovereign entity. While the United States recognizes this sovereignty, other countries may not.[242]\u000a\u000aThe United States has operated under a two-party system for most of its history.[243] For elective offices at most levels, state-administered primary elections choose the major party nominees for subsequent general elections. Since the general election of 1856, the major parties have been the Democratic Party, founded in 1824, and the Republican Party, founded in 1854. Since the Civil War, only one third-party presidential candidate\u2014former president Theodore Roosevelt, running as a Progressive in 1912\u2014has won as much as 20% of the popular vote. The third-largest political party is the Libertarian Party.\u000a\u000aWithin American political culture, the Republican Party is considered center-right or conservative and the Democratic Party is considered center-left or liberal.[244] The states of the Northeast and West Coast and some of the Great Lakes states, known as "blue states", are relatively liberal. The "red states" of the South and parts of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains are relatively conservative.\u000a\u000aThe winner of the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, Democrat Barack Obama, is the 44th U.S. president.\u000a\u000aIn the 113th United States Congress, the House of Representatives is controlled by the Republican Party, while the Democratic Party has control of the Senate. The Senate currently consists of 52 Democrats, two independents who caucus with the Democrats, and 46 Republicans; the House consists of 234 Republicans and 201 Democrats.[245] There are 30 Republican and 20 Democratic state governors.[246]\u000a\u000aSince the founding of the United States until the 2000s, the country's governance has been primarily dominated by White Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WASPs). However, the situation has changed recently and of the top 17 positions (four national candidates of the two major party in the 2012 U.S. presidential election, four leaders in 112th United States Congress, and nine Supreme Court Justices) there is only one WASP.[247][248][249]\u000a\u000aThe United States has an established structure of foreign relations. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and New York City is home to the United Nations Headquarters. It is a member of the G8,[250] G20, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Almost all countries have embassies in Washington, D.C., and many have consulates around the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host American diplomatic missions. However, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Bhutan, and the Republic of China (Taiwan) do not have formal diplomatic relations with the United States (although the U.S. still supplies Taiwan with military equipment).\u000a\u000aThe United States has a "special relationship" with the United Kingdom[251] and strong ties with Canada,[252] Australia,[253] New Zealand,[254] the Philippines,[255] Japan,[256] South Korea,[257] Israel,[258] and several EU countries, including France, Italy, Germany and Spain. It works closely with fellow NATO members on military and security issues and with its neighbors through the Organization of American States and free trade agreements such as the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. In 2008, the United States spent a net $25.4 billion on official development assistance, the most in the world. As a share of America's large gross national income (GNI), however, the U.S. contribution of 0.18% ranked last among 22 donor states. By contrast, private overseas giving by Americans is relatively generous.[259]\u000a\u000aThe U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for three sovereign nations through Compact of Free Association with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau, all of which are Pacific island nations which were part of the U.S.-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands beginning after World War II, and gained independence in subsequent years.\u000a\u000aTaxes are levied in the United States at the federal, state and local government level. These include taxes on income, payroll, property, sales, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. In 2010 taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of GDP.[260] During FY2012, the federal government collected approximately $2.45 trillion in tax revenue, up $147 billion or 6% versus FY2011 revenues of $2.30 trillion. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,132B or 47%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($845B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($242B or 10%).[261]\u000a\u000aU.S. taxation is generally progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and is among the most progressive in the developed world,[262][263][264][265][266] but the incidence of corporate income tax has been a matter of considerable ongoing controversy for decades.[267][268][269][270] In 2009 the top 10% of earners, with 36% of the nation's income, paid 78.2% of the federal personal income tax burden, while the bottom 40% had a negative liability.[265] However, payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $113,700 and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains.[271][272] The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers.[273][274] The top 10% paid 51.8% of total federal taxes in 2009, and the top 1%, with 13.4% of pre-tax national income, paid 22.3% of federal taxes.[265] In 2013 the Tax Policy Center projected total federal effective tax rates of 35.5% for the top 1%, 27.2% for the top quintile, 13.8% for the middle quintile, and \u22122.7% for the bottom quintile.[275][276] State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams, though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.[263][277]\u000a\u000aDuring FY 2012, the federal government spent $3.54 trillion on a budget or cash basis, down $60 billion or 1.7% vs. FY 2011 spending of $3.60 trillion. Major categories of FY 2012 spending included: Medicare & Medicaid ($802B or 23% of spending), Social Security ($768B or 22%), Defense Department ($670B or 19%), non-defense discretionary ($615B or 17%), other mandatory ($461B or 13%) and interest ($223B or 6%).[261]\u000a\u000aAs of April 2014, the total national debt in the United States was $18.527 trillion (106% of the GDP).[278] In May 2014, U.S. federal government debt held by the public was approximately $12.495 trillion, or about 75% of U.S. GDP. Intra-governmental holdings stood at $5 trillion, giving a combined total debt of $17.494 trillion.[279][280] By 2012, total federal debt had surpassed 100% of U.S. GDP.[281] The U.S. has a credit rating of AA+ from Standard & Poor's, AAA from Fitch, and Aaa from Moody's.[282]\u000a\u000aHistorically, the U.S. public debt as a share of GDP increased during wars and recessions, and subsequently declined. For example, debt held by the public as a share of GDP peaked just after World War II (113% of GDP in 1945), but then fell over the following 30 years. In recent decades, large budget deficits and the resulting increases in debt have led to concern about the long-term sustainability of the federal government's fiscal policies.[283] However, these concerns are not universally shared.[284]\u000a\u000aThe president holds the title of commander-in-chief of the nation's armed forces and appoints its leaders, the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The United States Department of Defense administers the armed forces, including the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. The Coast Guard is run by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and by the Department of the Navy during times of war. In 2008, the armed forces had 1.4 million personnel on active duty. The Reserves and National Guard brought the total number of troops to 2.3 million. The Department of Defense also employed about 700,000 civilians, not including contractors.[285]\u000a\u000aMilitary service is voluntary, though conscription may occur in wartime through the Selective Service System.[286] American forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Force's large fleet of transport aircraft, the Navy's 10 active aircraft carriers, and Marine Expeditionary Units at sea with the Navy's Atlantic and Pacific fleets. The military operates 865 bases and facilities abroad,[287] and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.[288] The extent of this global military presence has prompted some scholars to describe the United States as maintaining an "empire of bases".[289]\u000a\u000aThe Military budget of the United States in 2011, was more than $700 billion, 41% of global military spending and equal to the next 14 largest national military expenditures combined. At 4.7% of GDP, the rate was the second-highest among the top 15 military spenders, after Saudi Arabia.[290] U.S. defense spending as a percentage of GDP ranked 23rd globally in 2012 according to the CIA.[291] Defense's share of U.S. spending has generally declined in recent decades, from Cold War peaks of 14.2% of GDP in 1953 and 69.5% of federal outlays in 1954 to 4.7% of GDP and 18.8% of federal outlays in 2011.[292]\u000a\u000aThe proposed base Department of Defense budget for 2012, $553 billion, was a 4.2% increase over 2011; an additional $118 billion was proposed for the military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.[293] The last American troops serving in Iraq departed in December 2011;[294] 4,484 servicemen were killed during the Iraq War.[295] Approximately 90,000 U.S. troops were serving in Afghanistan in April 2012;[296] by November 8, 2013 2,285 had been killed during the War in Afghanistan.[297]\u000a\u000aLaw enforcement in the United States is primarily the responsibility of local police and sheriff's departments, with state police providing broader services. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties.[299] At the federal level and in almost every state, jurisprudence operates on a common law system. State courts conduct most criminal trials; federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. Plea bargaining in the United States is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled by plea bargain rather than jury trial.[300][301]\u000a\u000aIn 2012 there were 4.7 murders per 100,000 persons in the United States, a 54% decline from the modern peak of 10.2 in 1980.[302][303][304] Among developed nations, the United States has above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence and homicide.[305] A cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2003 showed that United States "homicide rates were 6.9 times higher than rates in the other high-income countries, driven by firearm homicide rates that were 19.5 times higher."[306] Gun ownership rights continue to be the subject of contentious political debate.\u000a\u000aCapital punishment is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and used in 32 states.[307] No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in part to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In 1976, that Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma.[308] Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or struck down death penalty laws. In 2010, the country had the fifth highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran, North Korea, and Yemen.[309]\u000a\u000aThe United States has the highest documented incarceration rate and total prison population in the world.[310][311][312][313] At the start of 2008, more than 2.3 million people were incarcerated, more than one in every 100 adults.[314] The prison population has quadrupled since 1980.[315] African-American males are jailed at about six times the rate of white males and three times the rate of Hispanic males.[316] The country's high rate of incarceration is largely due to changes in sentencing guidelines and drug policies.[317] In 2008, Louisiana had the highest incarceration rate, and Maine the lowest.[318] In 2012, Louisiana had the highest rate of murder and non negligent manslaughter in the U.S., and New Hampshire the lowest.[319]\u000a\u000aThe United States has a capitalist mixed economy which is fueled by abundant natural resources and high productivity.[328] According to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. GDP of $16.8 trillion constitutes 24% of the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 19% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity (PPP).[6] Its national GDP was about 5% larger at PPP in 2014 than the European Union's, whose population is around 62% higher.[329] However, the US's nominal GDP is estimated to be $17.528 trillion as of 2014, which is about 5% smaller than that of the European Union.[330] From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the G7.[331] The country ranks ninth in the world in nominal GDP per capita and sixth in GDP per capita at PPP.[6] The U.S. dollar is the world's primary reserve currency.[332]\u000a\u000aThe United States is the largest importer of goods and second largest exporter, though exports per capita are relatively low. In 2010, the total U.S. trade deficit was $635 billion.[333] Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, and Germany are its top trading partners.[334] In 2010, oil was the largest import commodity, while transportation equipment was the country's largest export.[333] China is the largest foreign holder of U.S. public debt.[335]\u000a\u000aIn 2009, the private sector was estimated to constitute 86.4% of the economy, with federal government activity accounting for 4.3% and state and local government activity (including federal transfers) the remaining 9.3%.[336] While its economy has reached a postindustrial level of development and its service sector constitutes 67.8% of GDP, the United States remains an industrial power.[337] The leading business field by gross business receipts is wholesale and retail trade; by net income it is manufacturing.[338]\u000a\u000aChemical products are the leading manufacturing field.[339] The United States is the third largest producer of oil in the world, as well as its largest importer.[340] It is the world's number one producer of electrical and nuclear energy, as well as liquid natural gas, sulfur, phosphates, and salt. While agriculture accounts for just under 1% of GDP,[337] the United States is the world's top producer of corn[341] and soybeans.[342] The National Agricultural Statistics Service maintains agricultural statistics for products that include peanuts, oats, rye, wheat, rice, cotton, corn, barley, hay, sunflowers, and oilseeds. In addition, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides livestock statistics regarding beef, poultry, pork, and dairy products. The National Mining Association provides data pertaining to coal and minerals that include beryllium, copper, lead, magnesium, zinc, titanium and others.[343][344] In the franchising business model, McDonald's and Subway are the two most recognized brands in the world. Coca-Cola is the most recognized soft drink company in the world.[345]\u000a\u000aConsumer spending comprises 71% of the U.S. economy in 2013.[346] In August 2010, the American labor force consisted of 154.1 million people. With 21.2 million people, government is the leading field of employment. The largest private employment sector is health care and social assistance, with 16.4 million people. About 12% of workers are unionized, compared to 30% in Western Europe.[347] The World Bank ranks the United States first in the ease of hiring and firing workers.[348] The United States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation[349] and is one of just a few countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia.[350] In 2009, the United States had the third highest labor productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. It was fourth in productivity per hour, behind those two countries and the Netherlands.[351]\u000a\u000aThe 2008-2012 global recession had a significant impact on the United States, with output still below potential according to the Congressional Budget Office.[352] It brought high unemployment (which has been decreasing but remains above pre-recession levels), along with low consumer confidence, the continuing decline in home values and increase in foreclosures and personal bankruptcies, an escalating federal debt crisis, inflation, and rising petroleum and food prices. There remains a record proportion of long-term unemployed, continued decreasing household income, and tax and federal budget increases.[353][354][355] A 2011 poll found that more than half of all Americans think the U.S. is still in recession or even depression, despite official data that shows a historically modest recovery.[356] In 2011 the Census Bureau defined poverty rate increased to roughly 16% of the population.[357]\u000a\u000aAmericans have the highest average household and employee income among OECD nations, and in 2007 had the second highest median household income.[31][358] According to the Census Bureau real median household income was $50,502 in 2011, down from $51,144 in 2010.[359] The Global Food Security Index ranked the U.S. number one for food affordability and overall food security in March 2013.[360] Americans on average have over twice as much living space per dwelling and per person as European Union residents, and more than every EU nation.[361]\u000a\u000aWealth, like income and taxes, is highly concentrated; the richest 10% of the adult population possess 72% of the country's household wealth, while the bottom half claim only 2%.[362] This is the second-highest share among developed nations.[363] In 2013 the United Nations Development Programme ranked the United States 16th among 132 countries on its inequality-adjusted human development index (IHDI), 13 places lower than in the standard HDI.[364] There has been a widening gap between productivity and median incomes since the 1970s.[365] While inflation-adjusted ("real") household income had been increasing almost every year from 1947 to 1999, it has since been flat and even decreased recently.[366]\u000a\u000aThe rise in the share of total annual income received by the top 1 percent, which has more than doubled from 9 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011, has had a significant impact on income inequality,[367] leaving the United States with one of the widest income distributions among OECD nations.[368][369][370] The post-recession income gains have been very uneven, with the top 1 percent capturing 95 percent of the income gains from 2009 to 2012.[371] Between June 2007 and November 2008 the global recession led to falling asset prices around the world. Assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value.[372] Since peaking in the second quarter of 2007, household wealth is down $14 trillion.[373] At the end of 2008, household debt amounted to $13.8 trillion.[374]\u000a\u000aThere were about 643,000 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in the U.S. in January 2009, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program. In 2011 16.7 million children lived in food-insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 1.1% of U.S. children, or 845,000, saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns at some point during the year, and most cases were not chronic.[375]\u000a\u000aPersonal transportation is dominated by automobiles, which operate on a network of 13 million roads, including one of the world's longest highway systems.[377] The world's second largest automobile market,[378] the United States has the highest rate of per-capita vehicle ownership in the world, with 765 vehicles per 1,000 Americans.[379] About 40% of personal vehicles are vans, SUVs, or light trucks.[380] The average American adult (accounting for all drivers and non-drivers) spends 55 minutes driving every day, traveling 29 miles (47 km).[381]\u000a\u000aMass transit accounts for 9% of total U.S. work trips.[382][383] While transport of goods by rail is extensive, relatively few people use rail to travel,[384] though ridership on Amtrak, the national intercity passenger rail system, grew by almost 37% between 2000 and 2010.[385] Also, light rail development has increased in recent years.[386] Bicycle usage for work commutes is minimal.[387]\u000a\u000aThe civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while most major airports are publicly owned. The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition of US Airways.[388] Of the world's 30 busiest passenger airports, 12 are in the United States, including the busiest, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.[389]\u000a\u000aThe United States energy market is 29,000 terawatt hours per year. Energy consumption per capita is 7.8 tons of oil equivalent per year, the 10th highest rate in the world. In 2005, 40% of this energy came from petroleum, 23% from coal, and 22% from natural gas. The remainder was supplied by nuclear power and renewable energy sources.[390] The United States is the world's largest consumer of petroleum.[391]\u000a\u000aFor decades, nuclear power has played a limited role relative to many other developed countries, in part because of public perception in the wake of a 1979 accident. In 2007, several applications for new nuclear plants were filed.[392] The United States has 27% of global coal reserves.[393] It is the world's largest producer of natural gas and crude oil.[394]\u000a\u000aThe United States has been a leader in scientific research and technological innovation since the late 19th century. In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone. Thomas Edison's laboratory developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera.[395] In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The Wright brothers, in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.[396]\u000a\u000aThe rise of Nazism in the 1930s led many European scientists, including Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and John von Neumann, to immigrate to the United States.[citation needed] During World War II, the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic Age. The Space Race produced rapid advances in rocketry, materials science, and computers.[citation needed] Advancements by American microprocessor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel along with both computer software and hardware companies that include Sun Microsystems, IBM, GNU-Linux, Apple Computer, and Microsoft refined and popularized the personal computer.[citation needed]\u000a\u000aThe ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department requirements, and became the first of a series of networks which evolved into the Internet. Today, 64% of research and development funding comes from the private sector.[397] The United States leads the world in scientific research papers and impact factor.[398] As of April 2010, 77% of American households owned at least one computer, and 68% had broadband Internet service.[399] 85% of Americans also own a mobile phone as of 2011.[400] The country is the primary developer and grower of genetically modified food, representing half of the world's biotech crops.[401]\u000a\u000aAmerican public education is operated by state and local governments, regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of six or seven (generally, kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[402] About 12% of children are enrolled in parochial or nonsectarian private schools. Just over 2% of children are homeschooled.[403] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world, spending more than $11,000 per elementary student in 2010 and more than $12,000 per high school student.[404] Some 80% of U.S. college students attend public universities.[405]\u000a\u000aThe United States has many competitive private and public institutions of higher education. According to prominent international rankings, 13 or 15 American colleges and universities are ranked among the top 20 in the world.[406][407] There are also local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition. Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[408] The basic literacy rate is approximately 99%.[4][409] The United Nations assigns the United States an Education Index of 0.97, tying it for 12th in the world.[410]\u000a\u000aAs for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. trails some other OECD nations but spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[404][411] As of 2012, student loan debt exceeded one trillion dollars, more than Americans owe on credit cards.[412]\u000a\u000aThe United States has a life expectancy of 78.4 years at birth, up from 75.2 years in 1990, ranking it 50th among 221 nations, and 27th out of the 34 industrialized OECD countries, down from 20th in 1990.[413][414] Increasing obesity in the United States and health improvements elsewhere have contributed to lowering the country's rank in life expectancy from 1987, when it was 11th in the world.[415] Obesity rates in the United States are among the highest in the world.[416] Approximately one-third of the adult population is obese and an additional third is overweight;[417] the obesity rate, the highest in the industrialized world, has more than doubled in the last quarter-century.[418] Obesity-related type 2 diabetes is considered epidemic by health care professionals.[419] The infant mortality rate of 6.17 per thousand places the United States 169th highest out of 224 countries.[420]\u000a\u000aIn 2010, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic accidents caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer's disease, drug abuse, kidney disease and cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.[414] U.S. teenage pregnancy and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other Western nations.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. is a global leader in medical innovation. America solely developed or contributed significantly to 9 of the top 10 most important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by a 2001 poll of physicians, while the EU and Switzerland together contributed to five. Since 1966, Americans have received more Nobel Prizes in Medicine than the rest of the world. From 1989 to 2002, four times more money was invested in private biotechnology companies in America than in Europe.[421][422] The U.S. health-care system far outspends any other nation, measured in both per capita spending and percentage of GDP.[423] Health-care coverage in the United States is a combination of public and private efforts and is not universal. In 2010, 49.9 million residents or 16.3% of the population did not carry health insurance. The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue.[424][425] In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance.[426] Federal legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health insurance system around the country by 2014, though the bill and its ultimate impact are issues of controversy.[427][428]\u000a\u000aThe United States is home to many cultures and a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values.[19][429] Aside from the relatively small Native American and Native Hawaiian populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five centuries.[430] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[19][431] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.[19]\u000a\u000aCore American culture was established by Protestant British colonists and shaped by the frontier settlement process, with the traits derived passed down to descendants and transmitted to immigrants through assimilation. Americans have traditionally been characterized by a strong work ethic, competitiveness, and individualism, as well as a unifying belief in an "American creed" emphasizing liberty, equality, private property, democracy, rule of law, and a preference for limited government.[432] Americans are extremely charitable by global standards. According to a 2006 British study, Americans gave 1.67% of GDP to charity, more than any other nation studied, more than twice the second place British figure of 0.73%, and around twelve times the French figure of 0.14%.[433][434]\u000a\u000aThe American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[435] Whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate.[436][437][438][439][331][440] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[441] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[442] Americans' self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree.[443] While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.[444]\u000a\u000aThe four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and Fox. Americans are the heaviest television viewers in the world,[445] and the average viewing time continues to rise, reaching five hours a day in 2006.[446] The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Americans listen to radio programming, also largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day.[447]\u000a\u000aIn 1998, the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public and/or private funds, subscriptions and corporate underwriting. Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR (formerly National Public Radio). NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967; its television counterpart, PBS, was also created by the same legislation. (NPR and PBS are operated separately from each other.)\u000a\u000aAside from web portals and search engines, the most popular websites are Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Blogger, eBay, and Craigslist.[448]\u000a\u000aWell-known newspapers are The New York Times, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal. Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have "alternative weeklies" to complement the mainstream daily paper(s), for example, New York City's Village Voice or Los Angeles' L.A. Weekly, to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups.\u000a\u000aIn Spanish, the second most widely spoken mother tongue behind English, more than 800 publications are published.[449][450] According to Internationale Medienhilfe more than 100 newspapers and magazines are produced in German, the language of the largest ethnic group in the USA. German-language weeklies like "New Yorker Staats-Zeitung" or "Nordamerikanische Wochen-Post" belong to the oldest still existing newspapers in North America.[451][452]\u000a\u000aThe world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope. The next year saw the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New York, and the United States was in the forefront of sound film's development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, California.\u000a\u000aDirector D. W. Griffith was central to the development of film grammar and Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941) is frequently cited as the greatest film of all time.[453][454] American screen actors like John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe have become iconic figures, while producer/entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising. Hollywood is also one of the leaders in motion picture production.[455]\u000a\u000aEarly versions of the American newspaper comic strip and the American comic book began appearing in the 19th century. In 1938, Superman, the quintessential comic book superhero of DC Comics, developed into an American icon.[456] Additional comic book publishers include; Marvel Comics, created in 1939, Image Comics, created in 1992, Dark Horse Comics, created in 1986, and numerous small press comic book companies. In celebration of the industry's success, annual comic conventions take place at The San Diego Comic-Con International, which has an attendance of over 130,000 visitors.\u000a\u000aThe rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s.[457]\u000a\u000aElvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America's most celebrated songwriters and James Brown led the development of funk. More recent American creations include hip hop and house music. American pop stars such as Presley, Michael Jackson, and Madonna have become global celebrities.[457]\u000a\u000aIn the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American poet.[458] A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character\u2014such as Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851), Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), and F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925)\u2014may be dubbed the "Great American Novel".[459]\u000a\u000aEleven U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Toni Morrison in 1993. William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway are often named among the most influential writers of the 20th century.[460] Popular literary genres such as the Western and hardboiled crime fiction developed in the United States. The Beat Generation writers opened up new literary approaches, as have postmodernist authors such as John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, and Don DeLillo.\u000a\u000aThe transcendentalists, led by Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, established the first major American philosophical movement. After the Civil War, Charles Sanders Peirce and then William James and John Dewey were leaders in the development of pragmatism. In the 20th century, the work of W. V. O. Quine and Richard Rorty, and later Noam Chomsky, brought analytic philosophy to the fore of American philosophical academia. John Rawls and Robert Nozick led a revival of political philosophy. Cornel West and Judith Butler have led a continental tradition in American philosophical academia. Globally influential Chicago school economists like Milton Friedman, James M. Buchanan, and Thomas Sowell have transcended discipline to impact various fields in social and political philosophy.[461][462]\u000a\u000aIn the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[463] Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.\u000a\u000aOne of the first major promoters of American theater was impresario P. T. Barnum, who began operating a lower Manhattan entertainment complex in 1841. The team of Harrigan and Hart produced a series of popular musical comedies in New York starting in the late 1870s. In the 20th century, the modern musical form emerged on Broadway; the songs of musical theater composers such as Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Stephen Sondheim have become pop standards. Playwright Eugene O'Neill won the Nobel literature prize in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple Pulitzer Prize winners Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, and August Wilson.\u000a\u000aThough little known at the time, Charles Ives's work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music. Choreographers Isadora Duncan and Martha Graham helped create modern dance, while George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins were leaders in 20th-century ballet. Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and Ansel Adams.\u000a\u000aMainstream American cuisine is similar to that in other Western countries. Wheat is the primary cereal grain. Traditional American cuisine uses indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup, which were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers.[citation needed]\u000a\u000aSlow-cooked pork and beef barbecue, crab cakes, potato chips, and chocolate chip cookies are distinctively American foods. Soul food, developed by African slaves, is popular around the South and among many African Americans elsewhere. Syncretic cuisines such as Louisiana Creole, Cajun, and Tex-Mex are regionally important. The confectionery industry in the United States includes The Hershey Company, the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America. In addition, Frito-Lay, a subsidiary of PepsiCo, is the largest globally distributed snack food company in the world. The United States has a vast breakfast cereal industry that includes brands such as Kellogg's and General Mills.\u000a\u000aCharacteristic dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants. French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed.[464] Americans generally prefer coffee to tea. Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages.[465][466]\u000a\u000aThe American fast food industry, the world's largest, pioneered the drive-through format in the 1930s. Fast food consumption has sparked health concerns. During the 1980s and 1990s, Americans' caloric intake rose 24%;[464] frequent dining at fast food outlets is associated with what public health officials call the American "obesity epidemic".[467] Highly sweetened soft drinks are widely popular, and sugared beverages account for nine percent of American caloric intake.[468]\u000a\u000aThe market for professional sports in the United States is roughly $69 billion, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[469] Baseball has been regarded as the national sport since the late 19th century, while American football is now by several measures the most popular spectator sport.[470] Basketball and ice hockey are the country's next two leading professional team sports. These four major sports, when played professionally, each occupy a season at different, but overlapping, times of the year. College football and basketball attract large audiences.[471] Boxing and horse racing were once the most watched individual sports,[472] but they have been eclipsed by golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR.[citation needed] In the 21st century, televised mixed martial arts has also gained a strong following of regular viewers.[473][474] While soccer is less popular in the United States than in many other nations, the men's national soccer team has been to the past six World Cups and the women are first in the women's world rankings.\u000a\u000aWhile most major U.S. sports have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, snowboarding, and cheerleading are American inventions, some of which have become popular in other countries. Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact.[475] Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The United States has won 2,400 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, more than any other country, and 281 in the Winter Olympic Games, the second most by 2014 trailing only Norway.[476]

VDogs are domesticated canines that have been closely associated with humans ever since they first evolved from gray wolves several thousand years ago. Throughout the world dogs are still intimately associated with humans in a variety of roles, and because of this they are often called "man's best friend". Today they are nearly ubiquitous, as household pets, cherished companions, full-time workers, and even, in some cultures, as food.\u000a\u000aDogs and people may communicate better with each other than any other two species.[2] Dogs and humans understand each other on a basic level: we are able to interpret the dog's instinctive body language (along with canine vocalizations like the growl and whine); and the dog, in turn, has an innate ability to respond appropriately both to human body language, as well as to the emotional tone of the human voice. Some research suggests that dogs may be better at interpreting cues from humans than even our closest relatives, the chimpanzees.[3] People can be educated beyond these basics to manage their dogs more precisely, and dogs can be trained to be extremely responsive to people. In addition, dogs can modify the behaviour of their humans to a surprising degree.\u000a\u000aBy the mid-20th century, scientists had generally agreed that the immediate ancestor of the dog must be one of its close living relatives: jackals, coyotes or wolves, but they had trouble deciding on which one.[4] Most early research depended on archeological evidence to try to solve the riddle of the dog's origin.\u000a\u000aThis issue was finally solved using DNA, which proved that the Gray Wolf is the sole ancestor of all modern dogs.[5][6] Therefore, dogs are a subspecies (Canis lupus familiaris) of the Gray Wolf (Canis lupus).[7] The first theories placed original ancestors in Asian populations of the wolves, based on the diversity of comparing the genetic diversity of Asian wolves with that of modern dog breeds[5] while the data is consistent with multiple domestication events.[5][6] However in 2013, scientists analyzing over 100 DNA samples across the world and compared them with 18 ancient European canid samples and discovered the DNA of modern dogs most closely matched that of ancient wolves from Europe, indicating that domestication of dogs began there initiated by hunter-gatherer humans.[8] They also concluded that dogs are descended from a population of ancient European wolves that are now extinct.[9]\u000a\u000aThrough the 1970s and 1980s, schoolchildren were taught that humans domesticated the dog. Nowadays, many scientists feel that a more accurate description would be that the relationship evolved on a more equal footing, with humans and dogs coming together to ensure their mutual survival in a hostile environment. Another way of looking at the question would be to ask if the domestication of the dog was a result of natural selection, in which nature plays the larger part in deciding which dogs survive; in this case the dogs which adapted most readily to humans in their environment, or of artificial selection--humans picking which dogs contributed to the gene pool based on which had traits humans found desirable--the precursor of selective breeding. Surveys and analysis have made cases for both theories.[10]\u000a\u000aThe relationship between humans and dogs is certainly an ancient one. Cave paintings such as one found in Tassili n'Ajjer suggest that primitive man and dog were already living in harmony.[11] Dogs in such images are portrayed as hunters, both in the company of humans and alone, which can be taken as an indication of a developed relationship. Precise dates for these drawings are frequently debated, as they existed before recorded history, and our dating techniques can be affected by many factors, but some of this rock art is several thousand years old. The earliest known domestic dog remains "may date back as far as 10,000 BC, preceding the Neolithic period....evidence indicates that dogs were kept in Jericho by 6500 BC."[12]\u000a\u000aBy the time of the pharaohs, dogs had already established their value as workers and human companions. Egyptian paintings show that selective breeding had already begun; sighthounds were clearly identified. Dog mummies have been found in the tombs of Pharaohs. The Assyrians, Greeks and Romans all used dogs for hunting and as battle companions. Pliny the Elder described the value of dogs in no uncertain terms, and also referred to the existence of--if not refined dog breeds, certainly defined dog types.[13][14][15] A Chinese ceramic statue from the era of the T'ang Dynasty, circa 700 A.D., depicts a dog bearing a resemblance to today's Dandie Dinmont Terrier.[16]\u000a\u000aBy the medieval period, hunters had classified dogs according to the type of game they were best suited to handle.[17]. By the 16th Century, Of Englische Dogges, the first written work specifically and exclusively about dogs, appeared.[18] Illustrations in The Hunt of the Unicorn, a series of medieval tapestries attributed as Flemish, circa 1500, show many domesticated hunting dogs, including hounds and terriers, and one somewhat like a Great Dane.[19]\u000a\u000aModern dog breeds show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal.\u000a\u000aDogs generally share attributes with their wild ancestors, the wolves. Dogs are both predators and scavengers, possessing sharp teeth and strong jaws for attacking, holding, and tearing their food. Although selective breeding has changed the appearance of many breeds, all dogs retain basic traits from their distant ancestors. Like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing. Compared to the bone structure of the human foot, dogs technically walk on their toes.\u000a\u000aBecause the lenses of dogs' eyes are flatter than humans', they cannot see as much detail; on the other hand, their eyes are more sensitive to light and motion than humans' eyes. Some dogs, the sight hounds, have been specifically bred to capitalize on their use of vision in tracking prey. These breeds include the Greyhound and Afghan Hound.[20] The most capable sighthounds have a field of vision up to 270° (compared to 180° for humans). Broad-headed dog breeds with forward set eyes have a much narrower field of vision, sometimes no wider than the human 180 degrees.\u000a\u000aDogs detect sounds as low as the 16 to 20 Hz frequency range (compared to 20 to 70 Hz for humans) and as high as 70 kHz to 100 kHz (compared to 13 to 20 kHz for humans), and in addition have a degree of ear mobility that helps them to rapidly pinpoint the exact location of a sound. Eighteen or more muscles can tilt, rotate and raise or lower a dog's ear. The dog's sensitivity to even very quiet sounds, as compared to a human's, means that a dog can identify a sound's location much faster, as well as hear sounds that are coming from far more distant sources than a human companion by its side.[21]\u000a\u000aThose with more open ear shapes, like the erect ears of wild canids like the fox, generally hear better than those with the floppier ears of many domesticated species.\u000a\u000aDogs have nearly 220 million smell-sensitive cells over an area about the size of a pocket handkerchief (compared to 5 million over an area the size of a postage stamp for humans). It is fair to say that all dogs have a richer olfactory experience than ours. Some breeds have been selectively bred for excellence in detecting scents, over and above their canine brethren, such as the scent hounds, including and particularly Bloodhounds.\u000a\u000aBitches (female dogs) have a reproductive cycle that generally varies from six months to one year, although there are bitches that come into oestrus more or less frequently. This season is the only time that bitches are receptive to mating.\u000a\u000aGestation, the period in which mammals carry their developing young in the uterus, lasts about two months (60-64 days). Whelping (the birth of puppies) usually takes place without incident. The dam (mother) ordinarily gives birth to more than one puppy at a time. The group of pups born together is known as a litter.\u000a\u000aDog breeders mate selected dogs together hoping to reproduce desired traits in the resulting offspring. Those who breed working dogs, such as herders, pick breeding stock that have instincts and abilities suited to the tasks the dogs are required to perform. By contrast, people who breed show dogs have strict sets of criteria to conform to; these are largely related to the dog's appearance and personality.\u000a\u000aSome dog owners view their pets as fully-fledged family members, and most dogs are able to act the part. That ability stems from two basic sources: (1) the "hard-wiring" of the dog's behavior (programmed by its canine genes), and (2) the individual dog's experience with people. Dogs are, like humans, highly social animals. Although the instincts to behave in ways that ease interactions in the pack are inborn in all normal dogs, the right early experiences are critical if puppies are to grow up into companionable dogs. Those "right" experiences have everything to do with contact with people and with other dogs, and they must occur early in the dog's life - probably before the puppy reaches 12 weeks of age.\u000a\u000aWhen puppies are raised with plenty of close contact to people and to other dogs, they become fully socialized. Socialized pups seem to view their human companions as members of their pack, and make few, if any, distinctions between their owners and fellow dogs. As these puppies mature, they can be taught to modify their behavior towards people, and treat their human companions more gently than their canine ones. Puppies who are raised without human nurturing have a harder time adjusting to interactions with owners once they have passed the critical period of about 3 months of age, no matter how much gentle attention is then given them. Orphaned puppies that are bottle fed and raised by humans alone, without any contact to any other dog or puppy, are in danger of becoming abnormally fixated on humans, and such puppies include animals that turn their attentions, sexual and social, to people instead of to dogs. Mounting behavior, for example is an annoyance to visitors and an embarrassment for owners. It not only signals sexual attention, but is a normal part of a dog's dominance behaviour, a tool for determining pack hierarchy. Proper dog-human socialization establishes the human's position as pack leader early, and eliminates the need for such trials.\u000a\u000aThe group of puppies born together is called a litter. That means that most pups are raised in a social group. However, in situations where puppies are isolated from other dogs, and are raised alone, without experiences in canine society, they can fail to learn the give and take of normal puppies. That's one reason that the dog or older puppy adopted from a shelter or obtained from a private seller can pose problems to a new owner. Brought out on a leash in streets where other dogs go by, or let off a leash in a dog park or outdoor space where other dogs are free, a poorly socialized dog may attack other dogs out of fear. Once grown, such pups most often can never be successfully integrated into a group of dogs.\u000a\u000aDogs fill a variety of roles in human society and are often trained as working dogs. Thousands of dogs throughout the world actively herd sheep and cattle, guard people and property, and guide the blind and disabled. Dogs are an important part of rescue work in natural disasters. Their noses aid police and military searches for weapons, drugs, and other contraband. However, the most common (and perhaps most important) role of dogs in many countries is as a human companion.\u000a\u000aJust as one individual animal might have a combination of traits that causes that particular dog to appear so different from another, there are diverse breeds of dogs, where each breed includes dogs that are very similar to each other, but distinct in some identifiable manner from the dogs of a different breed. Through the years, by concentrating particular genes and reducing other ones, breeds have developed in which each member shares a recognizable "brand" of canine style.\u000a\u000aIn kennel club terms, purebred dogs are individuals that have been selected to "breed true". That means that a good example of a pure bred (pedigreed) dog looks like its kind in physical appearance, and acts like its kind in general temperament and certain behaviors. Generally, two purebred parents of the same breed will always produce a litter of pups that will grow up to be quite like them in looks, temperament, and behavior, as opposed to resembling the types of dogs from which the breed originated. The two Chinese Shar Pei youngsters pictured at left show the famously loose and wrinkled skin of their kind, but there are many more characteristics that typify that breed, ranging from a blue-black tongue to a calm, confident stance.\u000a\u000aDogs have an enormous range of normal height and lean weight. The Chihuahua is the smallest of the purebreeds and the Irish Wolfhound is the largest. Despite the great differences in size between these two extremes, all dogs are the same species and can interbreed successfully, although now, thanks to human intervention and the development of dog breeds, care must be taken to only breed individual dogs that are compatible--the mating of a Chihuahua bitch (female) with a Great Dane, for example, would have disastrous consequences for the health of the female dog. Dogs also have an incredibly broad range of coat (fur) and skin colors and patterns, skull and face shape, pelage (fur) length and texture, tail shape and carriage, athletic ability and temperaments. All of these, along with other physical characteristics, are influenced by inherited genes. Even certain specific complex behaviors (like pointing, or retrieving) appear to be inherited in dogs. The gene pool of domestic dogs is highly diverse.\u000a\u000aPresently, over 800 dog breeds are recognized by breed and kennel clubs worldwide. Dogs can be registered with a club and receive certifications (commonly called "papers") that indicate a pedigreed purebred status.\u000a\u000aIn order to qualify for registration, a purebred puppy must have two registered parents of the same breed, and meet the breed standard: a description of a certain "look" (physical conformation) and other features. This breed standard specifies what features are acceptable, which are preferred, and, sometimes, specifies particular features that, if present, disqualify the dog from being chosen as best of its kind. For example, an AKC-registered bulldog with the preferred face, ears, stance, size, and most other qualities of the breed, in an AKC-sanctioned confirmation show, would still be disqualified if it had a "brown or liver-colored nose" [2].\u000a\u000aEach large kennel club hosts dog shows in which points are given for how well an individual dog compares to the breed standard, as compared to others of its type displayed at the same show. The male and female dogs competing in the top kennel clubs must be non-sterilized ("entire") animals and, although the gait and demeanor of the dog is evaluated as each walks around the show ring, the major emphasis is on body features. These contests are sometimes called conformational shows.\u000a\u000aIncreasingly, kennel clubs are catering to dogs and their owners through various shows and events other than conformational shows. The United Kennel Club was an innovator in this area; now such disciplines as agility, tracking, herding and carting are regularly sponsored by the American Kennel Club and others. Dogs may enter these shows and events whether or not they have been sterilized, and some of these events can include non-registered dogs and crossbreds as well.\u000a\u000aOther breeders concentrate on achieving uniform inherited behavioral traits in the dogs they produce. Some consider conformational traits important but secondary, some do not consider a dog's appearance at all, although this is rarer. Working, hunting, and herding dogs raised by field breeders sometimes only generally resemble the breed standard in appearance, but are more likely to be consistent in doing the job.\u000a\u000aThese may include breeds-in-development, breeds recognized in only one country, and breeds where there are differences in type from the variety of the breed recognized by kennel clubs and their affiliates.\u000a\u000aIn some parts of the world the isolation of dogs by geography (islands, mountain passes) has produced so-called natural breeds. These dogs are largely the product of natural selection. Members of a natural breed breed true - adults are similar to each other in appearance and behavior, and produce litters of puppies that not only grow up to resemble their parents, but - once grown, can between themselves propagate more litters of the breed. The Thai Bangkaew Dog is an example of a dog breed believed to have developed through isolation.\u000a\u000aSometimes these natural breeds have also undergone selective breeding by humans who desired a certain type of working dog. Such ancient working breeds include the Greyhound, the Mastiff and the Anatolian Shepherd Dog. Natural breeds made up many of the very first of the registered breeds, and also include some of the most recent additions to the list of breeds officially recognized by kennel clubs. Breed Recognition refers to the fact that a kennel club has officially acknowledged that the breed of dog has been shown to meet the requirements of the particular kennel club. This has nothing to do with the breed\u2019s actual purebred status and the date of official recognition may have no relation to how long the breed has been known to be in existence. The Shar Pei is a natural breed, "having existed for centuries in the southern provinces of China, apparently to the Han dynasty, circa 200 BC".[22] Despite the fact that statues of dogs that look just like the Shar Pei date back to the Thirteenth Century, the breed was not actually \u201crecognized\u201d until the later part of the Twentieth Century (initially by the Hong Kong Kennel Club). Other natural breeds have never been recognized formally by any kennel club.\u000a\u000aCrossbreds or crossbreeds can be loosely defined as animals with at least one known pure breed in its parentage. Crosses between purebreds have been used (along with mixed-breed crosses) to establish most of the long recognized dog breeds. This notwithstanding, today's animal welfare advocates have openly deplored this method for any current propagation of a new breed. That's because it necessarily produces generations of mixed-breed puppies in a world where there is already a great overpopulation of such dogs.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, there are modern dog breeders who purposely mate dogs of two completely different breeds in order to produce a litter of puppies with a set of desired characteristics that are not fully present in either individual parent. Some reasons for this include protecting a longstanding strain of dog that is not yet a true breed (a method used for example to gain official recognition for the Jack Russell Terrier, long-established but only officially recognised within the last ten years or so) or in response to changing times (the cross breeding of dogs to introduce the genes for a naturally short tail to a traditionally docked breed, in response to anti tail-docking legislation, for example). Crossbreeds in development are sometimes called a breed colloquially, but do not fulfill the requirement of "breeding true". It takes many generations of careful matings, and much disappointment along the way, to arrive at a bona fide new breed.\u000a\u000aAlthough the hybrid puppies in the cross between two purebreds (in breeders' terms, the F1 generation) often all look alike, these puppies cannot grow up and be mated to other dogs that were born of the same crossed parentage and reliably produce new puppies that are like them.\u000a\u000aThe breeders of notable crosses such as Cocker Spaniel-Poodle crosses, \u201cCockapoos\u201d and Labrador Retriever\u2013Poodle crosses \u201cLabradoodles\u201d, point out that development of a new breed is a worthy goal, and that, with ethical breeding practices, all puppies can be properly placed. In addition, some large commercial breeding operations that supply hybrid dogs claim to sell their puppies to pet shops under an agreement that every puppy is to be sterilized and therefore cannot ever used for breeding, this helps reduce indiscriminate breeding.\u000a\u000aDogs that came from parents who were not of any pure breed, or whose bloodlines comprise more than one breed, are called mongrels, mutts, or mixed-breed dogs. There are many other names for them, with varying levels of acceptability. The word \u2018\u2019mongrel\u2019\u2019, generally taken to be the correct formal word in dog fancy, is considered insulting by some dog lovers. That's probably because, in the English language, this word has sub-meanings that imply a lesser worth. However, it is fair to say that all dogs are derived from mongrels, and many scientists believe that in the absence of selective breeding, the dog would revert to the little brown pariah dog believed to be its most recent ancestor. Even the staunch proponents of purebreds generally agree that as pets, mixed-breed dogs offer their owners the same qualities of loyalty, intelligence and companionship that have come to be associated with dogs.\u000a\u000aBoth anecdotal evidence and scientific research suggest that dogs have a reasonably high intelligence. This intelligence is expressed differently in different breeds and individuals, along with sets of specific behaviors and talents that appear to be inherited. Optimal socialization and training of an individual dog is partly dependent on its own intelligence, inherited behaviors, and temperament.\u000a\u000aThe qualities characterized under the categories behaviour and temperament can have overlapping elements. These are related to intelligence, instinct and individual ability. They are often shaped by a dog\u2019s individual personality and can be modified by training.\u000a\u000aFormal training in obedience and other disciplines is offered by many kennel clubs and private training organizations.\u000a\u000aPolice and military organizations typically run their own specialized training or contract with specialists expert in this exacting work. These are typically referred to as K-9 (canine) units, where dogs are trained to sniff out drugs or explosives, rescue trapped or lost people, or attack on command. These are often considered on a par with their human handlers in many respects; for example, when one dies or is killed in action, they are accorded full ceremonial funerals.\u000a\u000aSince socialization to people and other dogs is part of the general training of puppies, many of the specialized training programs designed for dogs are given in classes. Not only do the dogs learn the skills taught, but they also learn to interact properly in a group situation.\u000a\u000aIf given the opportunity, dogs are omnivores, eating plant materials and animals. Generally, dogs will both scavenge carcasses and kill and eat animal prey.\u000a\u000aJust as there are schools of thought about human diet, with advocates of various strict regimens ranging from macrobiotics to raw foods, there are a number of diets recommended for dogs that involve an entire philosophy of dog health. The BARF diet is one with a large following. There are breeders who insist that puppies purchased from them be maintained on particular diets, and generally their wishes should be respected.\u000a\u000aWhen purchasing a puppy from a breeder, or adopting from a shelter, it is wise to find out the diet that the animal has been maintained on, and to make only gradual changes.\u000a\u000aIt is probably best to feed dogs a varied diet, supplemented with vitamins or high-quality commercial dog food. Most standard dog care guides stress that dogs should not be fed table scraps. This is because cooked bones can splinter internally, human food recipes can contain substances harmful for dogs, such as onions, and the fat in most table scraps is not any better for dogs than for people. In any case, there are widely-varying opinions and dogs have been known to do well on commercial food, raw food, home-cooked food, or, when their health requires it, special or restricted diets. When in doubt, dog owners should be guided by the advise of a veterinarian.\u000a\u000aIn the developed world, excessive fat is a problem for many dogs. Obese dogs can have health problems, and can benefit from restriction of calories in the diet and from increased exercise. Puppies, especially large and giant breed puppies, can suffer joint problems if fed too much highly nutritious food early on.\u000a\u000aDogs are susceptible to various diseases, ailments, and poisons, some of which affect humans in the same way, others of which are unique to dogs. Dogs, like all mammals, are also susceptible to heat exhaustion when dealing with high levels of humidity and/or extreme temperatures.[23]\u000a\u000aMost diseases are species-specific; so generally the diseases that affect dogs cannot be transmitted to humans, and vice versa. Rabies is an exception to this rule (see below). (Compare this with parasites, many of which can be transmitted between species.) Infectious diseases commonly associated with dogs include rabies (hydrophobia), canine parvovirus, and canine distemper. Congenital diseases of dogs can include a wide range from hip dysplasia and medial patellar luxation to epilepsy and pulmonic stenosis. Except for the many infections which are species specific, dogs are susceptible to the same ailments that humans are, including diabetes, epilepsy, hypothyroidism, dental disease, heart disease, cancer, and arthritis.\u000a\u000aImmunizations are available for many of the infectious diseases that affect dogs. Some of these diseases are passed from dog to dog, others to dogs through insects. Vaccinations for canine distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parainfluenza, canine parvovirus, Lyme disease and rabies are available. Some of these are combined in "one shot", and one - rabies - is often legally required of dog owners to provide for their dogs. That's because rabies is a fatal disease that can be transmitted by the bite of an infected dog.\u000a\u000aSome of these illnesses are only prevalent in certain regions of the world, and the selection of which immunizations is important varies according to geography.\u000a\u000aUnlike diseases, some parasites can be passed between dogs and humans. Common external parasites are various species of fleas, ticks, and mites. Internal parasites include hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms, and heartworms.\u000a\u000aGenerally, prevention of these parasites involves the administration of a systemic medicine or the use of applied chemicals through the wearing of collars or other means.\u000a\u000aSome categories of dogs are especially prone to certain genetic ailments, such as hip dysplasia, luxating patellae or cleft palate. Occasionally genetic disorders can be breed-related: blindness and deafness are disorders than have been linked to genes in specific breeds. Gastric torsion and bloat is a dangerous problem in some large-chested breeds.\u000a\u000aThe typical lifespan of dogs varies considerably by breed, and seems to be somewhat related to size. For example, many giant dog breeds average only 7 or 8 years, while some small terrier breeds might live as long as 20 years.The average lifespan for mixed-breed and midsize dogs is about 13 to 14 years.\u000a\u000aThere is no hard-and fast rule for the choosing of a pet. Among the many decisions that has to be made are whether to pick a purebred, crossbred or mutt, and what the individual can afford. Besides the initial outlay, the maintenance of dogs can be costly: food, shelter, training, health and dental care, emergency services, and boarding or home care all have to be considered. Dog owner's should be aware that, like humans, there are higher costs at the early and latter stages of a dog's life, when they have specialized needs.\u000a\u000aIn addition, owners should give consideration to what will happen to the dog in the event of the human's incapcity or death, and custody of family dogs in the event of divorce or separation.\u000a\u000aAlmost every breed of dog has an organized group of fanciers promoting it. Doing an internet search on the breed will yield a number of breeder sites, along with the various fanciers' organizations' web sites. Usually, one or more of the sites will list not only the attributes that are wonderful features of the breed, but any special health problems along with information for diagnosis and treatment.\u000a\u000aFinally, it is probably best to give some thought to the final disposition of the remains of a deceased dog, so that those decisions do not have to be made when one is grieving for a lost friend.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Humane Society of the United States, 3-4 million dogs and cats are euthanized each year in the United States and many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes. Spaying or neutering dogs helps keep overpopulation down.[3] Local humane societies, SPCAs and other animal protection organizations urge people to spay or neuter their pets and to adopt animals from shelters instead of purchasing them.\u000a\u000aIn the wild, in areas where wolves still roam but the human population is also established, there is the occasional inter-breeding of wolf and dog. Since a wolf pack is not likely to perceive a dog as anything but prey, and a domestic dog is unlikely to survive attack from even a lone wolf, this is not as common as the interbreeding of dogs and coyotes in similar circumstances. When dogs and coyotes do interbreed in the wild, the resulting hybrids often fail to thrive because they lack behavior features of the wild canine parent. For example, the domestic bitch ordinarily comes into heat twice or more times a year, where as the coyote female is fertile only once a year. The timing of the dog's estrus does not correspond to the local seasons in a way that is advantageous to a newborn litter, and so puppies born in the lean times of winter or drought are more likely to die. The instinct to only allow one mating pair of animals in the pack and the nurturing instincts of other pack members ( including the males) towards that pair's pups, is almost completely lost in the dog; and so hybrids in the wild are less able to raise litters that survive.\u000a\u000aIn human society, there are people who selectively breed wolves and dogs as pets. In many areas, there are currently laws against keeping wolves in captivity, but there are regions where this is not the case. Often, the breeder of these hybrids works not from full wolves, but selects a hybrid wolf/dog as one parent, and either another hybrid or a domestic dog as the other parent.\u000a\u000aMolecular genetic research has shown that dogs appear to have been domesticated from wolves, but not from wolves in general - instead, selected individual ancient wolves were kept and interbred. There is speculation that among the wolves that harried these early human settlements or frequented ancient dumps, the particular individuals chosen for "adoption" by people were probably not only very young - but were exceptionally "nice". There is variation in behavioral characteristics of individual members in every large group of wolves. It is not likely that the wild wolf pup who is at the extreme for aggressiveness, for example, would be tolerated in human society - once grown into an adult wolf, even if originally adopted in its infancy.\u000a\u000aThat has been the overall situation with wolf/dog hybrids. Even if carefully raised from birth, some adult wolf/dogs do not remain "tame" enough to safely interact with people. Breeders of wolf/dog hybrids routinely remove the puppies from the mother by 2-3 weeks of age, and hand raise them, bottle feeding the puppies every few hours. Each puppy is allowed contact with at least one other puppy, but all puppies are kept isolated from adult dogs and wolves (including their own mother) because if they are allowed contact they usually will not bond to their human handlers. That, of course, is not the case in pure domestic dog puppies, who can ordinarily be raised in the home with free access to both mother and human companions. Even with special nurturing of wolf/dog pups, and even though these hybrid puppies are usually much less than 50% wolf, there is an extremely high rate of attacks on humans by adult hybrid wolf/dogs - including the members of the human family that raised them. Breeders of hybrid wolf/dogs counsel that these dogs must at all times be fenced off from any possible contact with strangers [4]. Fatal human attacks by hybrids are not rare, and often victimize children.

Vbiology, study of living things and their vital processes. The field deals with all the physicochemical aspects of life. As a result of the modern tendency to unify scientific knowledge and investigation, however, there has been an overlapping of the field of biology with other scientific disciplines. Modern principles of other sciences\u2014chemistry and physics, for example\u2014are integrated with those of biology in such areas as biochemistry and biophysics.\u000a\u000aBecause biology is such a broad subject, it is subdivided into separate branches for convenience of study. Despite apparent differences, all the subdivisions are interrelated by basic principles. Thus, though it was once the custom to separate the study of plants (botany) from that of animals (zoology), and the study of the structure of organisms (morphology) from that of function (physiology), the current practice is to investigate those biological phenomena that all living things have in common.\u000a\u000aBiology is often approached today on the basis of levels that deal with fundamental units of life. At the level of molecular biology, for example, life is regarded as a manifestation of chemical and energy transformations that occur among the many chemical constituents that comprise an organism. As a result of the development of more powerful and precise laboratory instruments and techniques, it is now possible to understand and define more exactly not only the invisible ultimate physiochemical organization (ultrastructure) of the molecules in living matter but also how living matter reproduces at the molecular level.\u000a\u000aCell biology, the study of the fundamental unit of structure and function in a living organism, may be said to have begun in the 17th century, with the invention of the compound microscope. Before that, the individual organism was studied as a whole (organismic biology), an area of research still regarded as an important level of biological organization. Population biology deals with groups or populations of organisms that inhabit a given area or region. Included at this level are studies of the roles that specific kinds of plants and animals play in the complex and self-perpetuating interrelationships that exist between the living and nonliving world, as well as studies of the built-in controls that maintain these relationships naturally.\u000a\u000aThese broadly based levels may be further subdivided into such specializations as morphology, taxonomy, biophysics, biochemistry, genetics, eugenics, and ecology.\u000a\u000aIn another way of classification, a field of biology may be especially concerned with the investigation of one kind of living thing\u2014e.g., botany, the study of plants; zoology, the study of animals; ornithology, the study of birds; ichthyology, the study of fishes; mycology, the study of fungi; microbiology, the study of microorganisms; protozoology, the study of one-celled animals; herpetology, the study of amphibians and reptiles; entomology, the study of insects; and physical anthropology, the study of man.

VThe period for nominations to the Citizendium Council and for proposing referenda is now underway. Closes June 11th. Go to: Nominations ; Referenda ; General Info & Voting\u000a\u000aThe Republic of India (Hindi: \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u0917\u0923\u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u092f Bh\u0101rat Ga\u1e47ar\u0101jya) is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by geographical area, the second most populous country, and the most populous liberal democracy in the world. India has a coastline of over seven thousand kilometres, bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the west, and the Bay of Bengal on the east. India borders Pakistan to the west;[1] the People's Republic of China, Nepal and Bhutan to the north-east; and Bangladesh and Burma to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka, Maldives and Indonesia.\u000a\u000aHome to the Indus Valley Civilization and a region of historic trade routes and vast empires, the Indian subcontinent was identified with its commercial and cultural wealth for much of its long history. Four major world religions, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism originated here, while Islam, Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism arrived in the first millennium CE and shaped India's variegated culture. Gradually annexed by the British East India Company from the early eighteenth century and controlled by Britain from the mid-nineteenth century, India became a modern nation-state in 1947 after a struggle for independence marked by widespread use of nonviolent resistance as a means of social protest.\u000a\u000aWith the world's fourth largest economy in purchasing power and the second fastest growing large economy, India has made rapid progress in the last decade, especially in information technology. India deals with many economic and social problems, as do most evolving democracies. Common problems facing the country include high levels of poverty, illiteracy, persistent malnutrition, and environmental degradation. However, India is a rapidly advancing country, with an economy that is currently doing better than most countries in the region. A pluralistic, multi-lingual, multi-ethnic country, India is also home to a diversity of wildlife in a variety of protected habitats.\u000a\u000aThe name India /'\u026andi\u0259/ is derived from Indus, which is derived from the Old Persian word Hindu, from Sanskrit Sindhu, the historic local appellation for the Indus River.[2]. The ancient Greeks referred to the ancient Indians as Indoi, the people of the Indus. [3]\u000a\u000aThe Constitution of India and common usage in Hindi also recognise Bharat as an official name of equal status. A third name, \u0647\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646, Hindustan (Persian: Land of the Hindus), has been in use since the twelfth century, though its contemporary use is unevenly applied.\u000a\u000aStone Age rock shelters with paintings at the Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka in Madhya Pradesh are the earliest known traces of human life in India. The first known permanent settlements appeared over 9,000 years ago and gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilization, dating back to 3300 BCE in western India. It was followed by the Vedic Civilisation, which laid the foundations of Hinduism and other cultural aspects of early Indian society. From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known as the Mahajanapadas were established across the country.\u000a\u000aThe empire built by the Maurya dynasty under Emperor Chandragupta Maurya and expanded by Ashoka the Great united most of modern South Asia in third century BCE. From 180 BCE, a series of invasions from Central Asia followed, including those led by the Indo-Greeks, Indo-Scythians, Indo-Parthians and Kushans (or Yuezhi) in the northwestern Indian Subcontinent. From the third century CE, the Gupta dynasty oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's "Golden Age." While the north had larger, fewer kingdoms, South India had several dynasties such as the Chalukyas, Cholas, Pallavas and Pandyas, which overlapped in time and territory. In particular, the thassalocratic Chola Empire stretched across the east coast of India and extended to large parts of South-East Asia.\u000a\u000aScience, engineering, art, literature, astronomy, and philosophy flourished under the patronage of these kings.\u000a\u000aIslam first arrived in India through Arab traders in the 7th and 8th centuries. Military excursions by Muhammad bin-Qasim of the Ummayyid Caliphate began the first Islamic conquest of the subcontinent. This was followed by invasions from Afghanistan between the tenth and twelfth centuries, leading to the takeover of the country under the rule of the Delhi Sultanate, and later the Mughal dynasty by Central Asian invaders. Mughal emperors gradually expanded their kingdoms to cover large parts of the subcontinent. Nevertheless, several indigenous kingdoms, such as the Vijayanagara Empire, flourished, especially in the south. In the seventeenth and eighteenth century, the Mughal supremacy declined and the Hindu Maratha Confederation, under the Chhatrapati Shivaji Raja Bhonsle, became the dominant power. From the sixteenth century, several European countries, including Portugal, Netherlands, Denmark, France and Britain started arriving as traders and later took advantage of the fractious nature of relations between the kingdoms to establish colonies in the country. By 1856, most of India was under the control of the British East India Company. A year later, a nationwide insurrection of rebelling military units and kingdoms, variously referred to as the First War of Indian Independence or Sepoy Mutiny, seriously challenged British rule but eventually failed. As a consequence, India came under the direct control of the British Crown as a colony of the British Empire.\u000a\u000aDuring the first half of the twentieth century, a nationwide struggle for independence was launched by the Indian National Congress and other political and revolutionary organisations. Millions of protesters engaged in mass campaigns of civil disobedience with a commitment to ahimsa or non-violence, led by Mahatma Gandhi. Finally, on 15 August, 1947, India gained independence from British rule, but not before losing its Muslim-majority areas, which were carved out into the separate nation-state of Pakistan. In 1950 India became a republic, and a new constitution came into effect.\u000a\u000aSince independence, India has experienced sectarian violence and insurgencies in various parts of the country, but has maintained its unity and democracy. It has unresolved territorial disputes with China, which in 1962 escalated into the brief Sino-Indian War, resulting in a tactical victory for China; and with Pakistan, which resulted in wars in 1947, 1965, 1971 and in 1999 in Kargil. India is a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement and the United Nations (as part of British India). In 1974, India conducted an underground nuclear test, called "Smiling Buddha." This was followed by five more tests in 1998. Significant economic reforms beginning in 1991 have transformed India into one of the fastest-growing economies, adding to its global and regional clout.\u000a\u000aIndia is the largest democracy in the world. The Constitution defines India as a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic. India has a federal form of government and a bicameral parliament operating under a parliamentary system.\u000a\u000aThe President of India is the official head of state, elected indirectly by an electoral college for a five-year term. The Prime Minister is the head of government and exercises most executive powers. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President, with the requirement that they enjoy the support of the party or coalition securing the majority of seats in the lower house of Parliament.\u000a\u000aThe legislature of India is the bicameral Parliament, which consists of the upper house called the Rajya Sabha (Council of States), and the lower house called the Lok Sabha (House of People). The Rajya Sabha has up to 250 members serving staggered six year terms. Most are elected indirectly by the state and territorial legislatures in proportion to the state's population. The Lok Sabha's 545 members are directly elected by popular vote to represent individual constituencies for five year terms.\u000a\u000aThe executive branch consists of the President, Vice-President, and the Council of Ministers (the Cabinet being its executive committee) headed by the Prime Minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of either house of parliament. In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature, with the Prime Minister and his Council being directly responsible to the lower house of the parliament.[4]\u000a\u000aIndia's independent judiciary consists of the Supreme Court, headed by the Chief Justice of India. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over disputes between states and the Centre, appellate jurisdiction over the twenty-one High Courts of India, and the power to declare union and state laws null and void if in conflict with the basic structure of the Constitution of India.[4]\u000a\u000aFor most of its democratic history, the Government of India has been led by the left-wing centrist Indian National Congress (INC). State politics have been dominated by several national parties including INC, the center-right Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the far-left Communist Party of India (CPI) and various regional parties. From 1950 to 1990, the INC enjoyed a parliamentary majority barring two brief periods. The INC was out of power between 1977 and 1980, when the Janata Party won the election owing to public discontent with the "Emergency" declared by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. A Janata Dal coalition, called the National Front, won elections in 1989 but managed to stay in power for only two years.\u000a\u000aThe years 1996-1998 were a period of turmoil in the federal government with several short-lived alliances holding sway. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996, followed by the United Front coalition. In 1998, the BJP formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) with several regional parties, and became the first non-Congress government to complete a full five-year term. In the 2004 Indian elections the Indian National Congress won the largest number of Lok Sabha seats and formed a government with a coalition called the United Progressive Alliance, supported by a various left-leaning parties and members opposed to the BJP.\u000a\u000aSince independence in 1947, India has maintained cordial diplomatic relationships with most nations. It took a leading role in the 1950s by advocating the independence of European colonies in Africa and Asia. India is one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement. After the Sino-Indian War and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, India's relationship with the Soviet Union warmed at the expense of ties with the United States and continued to remain so until the end of the Cold War. India has fought several wars with Pakistan, primarily over Kashmir. The Indo-Pakistani war of 1971 was a particularly notable victory for India over Pakistan, which resulted in the independence of the province of East Pakistan, renamed Bangladesh.\u000a\u000aDespite criticism and military sanctions, India has consistently refused to sign the CTBT and the NPT, preferring instead to maintain sovereignty over its nuclear program. Recent overtures by the Indian government have strengthened relations with the United States, China, and Pakistan. In the economic sphere, India has close relationships with other developing nations in South America, Asia, and Africa. In recent years, India has played an influential role in the ASEAN, SAARC, and the WTO. India has been a long time supporter of the United Nations, with over 55,000 Indian military and police personnel having served in 35 UN peace keeping operations deployed across four continents.[5]. More recently, India fought a war with Pakistan in Kargil in 1999 which ended largely in India's favor.[6][7][8]\u000a\u000aIndia maintains the third largest military force in the world, which consists of an army, navy and air force. Auxiliary forces such as the Paramilitary Forces, the Coast Guard, and the Strategic Forces Command also come under the military's purview. The President is the supreme commander of the Indian armed forces. India also became a nuclear state in 1974 after conducting an initial nuclear test explosion. Further underground testing in 1998 led to international military sanctions against India, which were gradually withdrawn after September 2001. Recently, India concluded a deal with the United States that would allow the latter to supply Indian reactors with civilian nuclear technology and fuel. India maintains a "no-first-use" nuclear policy.\u000a\u000aIndia is a union of twenty-nine states and seven federally-governed union territories. All states, and the union territories of Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi have elected governments. The other five union territories have centrally-appointed administrators.\u000a\u000aAll states and union territories are subdivided into districts. In larger states, districts may be grouped together to form a division.\u000a\u000aIndia constitutes the major portion of the Indian subcontinent, which sits atop the Indian Plate and the northwesterly portion of the Indo-Australian Plate. India's northern and north-eastern states are partially situated in the Himalayan Range. The rest of northern, central, and eastern India consists of the fertile Indo-Gangetic Plain. In the west, bordering southeastern Pakistan, lies the Thar Desert. Southern India is almost entirely composed of the peninsular Deccan plateau, which is flanked by two hilly coastal ranges, the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats.\u000a\u000aIndia is home to several major rivers, including the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, the Yamuna, the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, the Narmada, the Krishna and the Tapti. India has three archipelagos \u2014 Lakshadweep, which lies off the southwestern coast; the volcanic Andaman and Nicobar Islands island chain to the southeast, and the Sunderbans in the Ganges Delta of West Bengal.\u000a\u000aThe climate of India varies from tropical in the south to more temperate in the Himalayan north, where elevated regions receive sustained winter snowfall. India's climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert. The Himalayas, along with the Hindu Kush mountains in Pakistan, prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in. This keeps the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert is responsible for attracting the moisture-laden summer monsoon winds that, between June and September, provide most of India's rainfall.\u000a\u000aIndia, lying within the Indomalaya ecozone, hosts significant biodiversity; it is home to 7.6% of all mammalian, 12.6% of avian, 6.2% of reptilian, and 6.0% of flowering plant species.[9] Many ecoregions, such as the shola forests, also exhibit extremely high rates of endemism; overall, 33% of Indian plant species are endemic.[10][11] India's forest cover ranges from the tropical rainforest of the Andaman Islands, Western Ghats, and Northeast India to the coniferous forest of the Himalayas. Between these extremes lie the sal-dominated moist deciduous forest of eastern India; teak-dominated dry deciduous forest of central and southern India; and the babul-dominated thorn forest of the central Deccan and western Gangetic plain.[12] Important Indian trees include the medicinal neem, widely used in rural Indian herbal remedies. The pipal fig tree, shown on the seals of Mohenjo-daro, shaded the Gautama Buddha as he sought enlightenment.\u000a\u000aMany Indian species are descendants of taxa originating in Gondwana, to which India originally belonged. Peninsular India's subsequent movement towards, and collision with, the Laurasian landmass set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic changes 20 million years ago caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.[13] Soon thereafter, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes on either side of the emerging Himalayas.[12] As a result, among Indian species, only 12.6% of mammals and 4.5% of birds are endemic, contrasting with 45.8% of reptiles and 55.8% of amphibians.[9] Notable endemics are the Nilgiri leaf monkey and the brown and carmine Beddome's toad of the Western Ghats. India contains 172, or 2.9%, of IUCN-designated threatened species.[14] These include the Asiatic lion, the Bengal tiger, and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which suffered a near-extinction from ingesting the carrion of diclofenac-treated cattle.\u000a\u000aIn recent decades, human encroachment has posed a threat to India's wildlife; in response, the system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was substantially expanded. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial habitat; further federal protections were promulgated in the 1980s. Along with more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries, India now hosts fourteen biosphere reserves, four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; twenty-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.\u000a\u000aFor most of its post-independence history, India adhered to a quasi-socialist approach, with strict government control over private sector participation, foreign trade, and foreign direct investment. However, since 1991, India has gradually opened up its markets through economic reforms and reduced government controls on foreign trade and investment. Foreign exchange reserves have risen from US$5.8 billion in March 1991 to US$177 billion in January 2007, while federal and state budget deficits have reduced.[15] Privatisation of publicly-owned companies and the opening of certain sectors to private and foreign participation has continued amid political debate.\u000a\u000aThe economy of India is the fourth largest in the world as measured by purchasing power parity (PPP). With a gross domestic product (GDP) of US $4.164 trillion, it is behind only the U.S., China, and Japan. [16] When measured in U.S. dollar-exchange-rate terms, it is the twelfth largest in the world, with a GDP of US $930.0 billion (2007).[17] India is the second fastest growing major economy in the world, with a GDP growth rate of 9.2% at the end of the second quarter of 2006\u20132007.[18] However, India's huge population results in a per capita income of $3800 at PPP and $796 at nominal.[16]\u000a\u000aWealth distribution in India, a developing country, is fairly uneven, with the top 10% of income groups earning 33% of the income.[19] In 2007, The Times newspaper reported that "India's recent economic gains, while enriching the social elite and middle classes, have failed to benefit almost half of its 1.1 billion people."[20] This was prompted by a survey finding that 47% of Indian children suffered from malnutrition.[21]\u000a\u000aIndia has a labour force of 509.3 million, 60% of which is employed in agriculture and related industries. Major agricultural crops include rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes. The agricultural sector accounts for 28% of GDP; the service and industrial sectors make up 54% and 18% respectively. Major industries include automobiles, cement, chemicals, consumer electronics, food processing, machinery, mining, petroleum, pharmaceuticals, steel, transportation equipment, and textiles.[16]\u000a\u000aIn 2006, estimated exports stood at US$112 billion and imports were around US $187.9 billion. Textiles, jewelry, engineering goods and software are major export commodities. Crude oil, machineries, fertilizers, and chemicals are major imports. India's most important trading partners are the U.S., the European Union, China, and the United Arab Emirates.[16] More recently, India has capitalised on its large pool of educated, English-speaking people to become an important outsourcing destination for multinational corporations. India has also become a major exporter of software as well as financial, research, and technological services.\u000a\u000aWith an estimated population of 1.1 billion, India is the world's second most populous country.[22] Almost 70% of Indians reside in rural areas, although in recent decades migration to larger cities has led to the exponential rise in the urban population. India's largest urban agglomerations are Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Bangalore.\u000a\u000aIndia is home to two major linguistic families: Indo-Aryan (spoken by about 74% of the population) and Dravidian (spoken by about 24%). Other languages spoken in India come from the Austro-Asiatic and Tibeto-Burman linguistic families. The Indian constitution recognises 23 official languages.[23] Hindi and English are used by the Union Government of India for official purposes, wherein Hindi has a legal priority. Sanskrit and Tamil enjoy classical language status in India. The number of dialects in India is as high as 1,652.[24]\u000a\u000aAlthough 80.5% of Indians report themselves as Hindus, India's Muslim population is the world's second largest; they constitute 13.4% of the population. Other religious groups include Christians (2.3%), Sikhs (1.9%), Buddhists (0.8%), Jains (0.4%), Jews, Zoroastrians, Bahá'ís and others.[22] Eight percent of India's people are classified as tribal.[22]\u000a\u000aAt the time of India's emergence as a nation-state in 1947, India's literacy rate was 11%.[25] Since then, it has increased to 68.6% (58.25% for females and 78.8% of males). The state of Kerala has the highest literacy rate (91%); Bihar has the lowest (47%).[26] The national sex ratio is 944 females per 1,000 males. India's median age is 24.7, and the population growth rate of 1.38% per annum; there are 22.3 births per 1,000 people.[22]\u000a\u000aIndia's culture is marked by a high degree of syncretism; it has managed to preserve established traditions whilst absorbing new customs, traditions, and ideas from invaders and immigrants. Many Indian cultural practices, languages, customs, and monuments are examples of this co-mingling over centuries. Famous monuments, such as the Taj Mahal and other examples of Islamic architecture, have been inherited from the Mughal dynasty. These are the result of traditions that combined elements from all parts of the country.\u000a\u000aIndian music is highly diversified. Classical music is mainly split between the North Indian Hindustani and South Indian Carnatic traditions. Highly regionalised forms of popular music include filmi and folk music like bhangra. Many classical dance forms exist, including Bharatanatyam, Kathakali, Kathak, Kuchipudi, Manipuri, Odissi and Yakshagana. They often have a narrative form and are usually infused with devotional and spiritual elements.\u000a\u000aThe earliest literary traditions in India were mostly oral, and were only later transcribed. Most of these are represented by religious texts such as the Vedas, the Mahabharata, and the Ramayana; Sangam literature from Tamil Nadu is among India's oldest. The many notable Indian writers of the modern era, using both Indian languages and in English, include Rabindranath Tagore.\u000a\u000aThe Indian film industry is the world's most prolific; its most recognisable face is the Mumbai-based "Bollywood", which produces mainly Hindi films. Other strong cinema industries are based on the Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali, and Marathi languages.\u000a\u000aThe cuisine of India is extremely diverse, as ingredients, spices and cooking methods vary from region to region. Rice and wheat are the nation's main staple foods. The country is notable for its wide variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian cuisine. Spicy food and sweets are popular in India.\u000a\u000aTraditional Indian dress greatly varies across the regions in its colours and styles, and depend on various factors, including climate. Popular styles of dress include the sari for women and the lungi or dhoti for men.\u000a\u000aIndia's national sport is field hockey, although cricket is the most popular sport in India. In some states, particularly those in the northeast and the coastal states of West Bengal, Goa and Kerala, football is the more popular sport. In recent times, tennis has gained popularity. Chess, commonly held to have originated in India, is also gaining popularity with the rise of the number of recognised Indian grandmasters. Traditional sports include kabaddi, kho-kho, and gilli-danda, which are played nationwide. India is home to the age-old discipline of yoga, and also to the ancient martial art, kalarippayattu.\u000a\u000aIndian festivals come in a vast variety; many are celebrated irrespective of caste and creed. The most popular holidays are Diwali, Holi, Onam, Sankranti/Pongal, Gudi Padwa/Ugadi, Durgapuja, Dussehra, the two Eids, Christmas, and Vaisakhi. India has three national holidays. Other sets of holidays, varying between nine and twelve, are officially observed in the individual states. Religious practices are an integral part of everyday life and are a very public affair. Traditional Indian family values are highly respected, although many urban families now prefer a nuclear family system due to the socio-economic constraints imposed by the traditional joint family system.\u000a\u000aSome content on this page may previously have appeared on Wikipedia.

VAt the cellular level of organization, the main chemical processes of all living matter are similar, if not identical. This is true for animals, plants, fungi, or bacteria; where variations occur (such as, for example, in the secretion of antibodies by some molds), the variant processes are but variations on common themes. Thus, all living matter is made up of large molecules called proteins, which provide support and coordinated movement, as well as storage and transport of small molecules, and, as catalysts, enable chemical reactions to take place rapidly and specifically under mild temperature, relatively low concentration, and neutral conditions (i.e., neither acidic nor basic). Proteins are assembled from some 20 amino acids, and, just as the 26 letters of the alphabet can be assembled in specific ways to form words of various lengths and meanings, so may tens or even hundreds of the 20 amino-acid \u201cletters\u201d be joined to form specific proteins. Moreover, those portions of protein molecules involved in performing similar functions in different organisms often comprise the same sequences of amino acids.\u000a\u000aThere is the same unity among cells of all types in the manner in which living organisms preserve their individuality and transmit it to their offspring. For example, hereditary information is encoded in a specific sequence of bases that make up the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) molecule in the nucleus of each cell. Only four bases are used in synthesizing DNA: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. Just as the Morse Code consists of three simple signals\u2014a dash, a dot, and a space\u2014the precise arrangement of which suffices to convey coded messages, so the precise arrangement of the bases in DNA contains and conveys the information for the synthesis and assembly of cell components. Some primitive life-forms, however, use RNA (ribonucleic acid; a nucleic acid differing from DNA in containing the sugar ribose instead of the sugar deoxyribose and the base uracil instead of the base thymine) in place of DNA as a primary carrier of genetic information. The replication of the genetic material in these organisms must, however, pass through a DNA phase. With minor exceptions, the genetic code used by all living organisms is the same.\u000a\u000aThe chemical reactions that take place in living cells are similar as well. Green plants use the energy of sunlight to convert water (H O) and carbon dioxide (CO ) to carbohydrates (sugars and starches), other organic (carbon-containing) compounds, and molecular oxygen (O ). The process of photosynthesis requires energy, in the form of sunlight, to split one water molecule into one-half of an oxygen molecule (O ; the oxidizing agent) and two hydrogen atoms (H; the reducing agent), each of which dissociates to one hydrogen ion (H+) and one electron. Through a series of oxidation-reduction reactions, electrons (denoted e-) are transferred from a donating molecule (oxidation), in this case water, to an accepting molecule (reduction) by a series of chemical reactions; this \u201creducing power\u201d may be coupled ultimately to the reduction of carbon dioxide to the level of carbohydrate. In effect, carbon dioxide accepts and bonds with hydrogen, forming carbohydrates (C [H O] ).\u000a\u000aLiving organisms that require oxygen reverse this process: they consume carbohydrates and other organic materials, using oxygen synthesized by plants to form water, carbon dioxide, and energy. The process that removes hydrogen atoms (containing electrons) from the carbohydrates and passes them to the oxygen is an energy-yielding series of reactions.\u000a\u000aIn plants, all but two of the steps in the process that converts carbon dioxide to carbohydrates are the same as those steps that synthesize sugars from simpler starting materials in animals, fungi, and bacteria. Similarly, the series of reactions that take a given starting material and synthesize certain molecules that will be used in other synthetic pathways are similar, or identical, among all cell types. From a metabolic point of view, the cellular processes that take place in a lion are only marginally different from those that take place in a dandelion.

Because of this, primes can be regarded as the multiplicative \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d for the natural numbers (all whole numbers greater than zero\u2014e.g., 1, 2, 3, \u2026).\u000a\u000aPrimes have been recognized since antiquity, when they were studied by the Greek mathematicians Euclid (fl. c. 300 bce) and Eratosthenes of Cyrene (c. 276\u2013194 bce), among others. In his Elements, Euclid gave the first known proof that there are infinitely many primes. Various formulas have been suggested for discovering primes (see number games: Perfect numbers and Mersenne numbers and Fermat prime), but all have been flawed. Two other famous results concerning the distribution of prime numbers merit special mention: the prime number theorem and the Riemann zeta function.\u000a\u000aSince the late 20th century, with the help of computers, prime numbers with millions of digits have been discovered (see Mersenne number). Like efforts to generate ever more digits of \u03c0, such number theory research was thought to have no possible application\u2014that is, until cryptographers discovered how large primes could be used to make nearly unbreakable codes (see cryptology: Two-key cryptography).

p39
VThe domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris,[2][3] previously Canis familiaris) is a member of the Canidae family of the mammalian order Carnivora. The term "domestic dog" is generally used for both domesticated and feral varieties. The dog was the first domesticated animal[4][5] and has been the most widely kept working, hunting, and pet animal in human history.[citation needed] The word "dog" can also refer to the male of a canine species,[6] as opposed to the word "bitch" which refers to the female of the species.\u000a\u000aRecent studies of "well-preserved remains of a dog-like canid from the Razboinichya Cave" in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia concluded that a particular instance of early wolf domestication approximately 33,000 years ago did not result in modern dog lineages, possibly because of climate disruption during the Last Glacial Maximum.[4][7] The authors postulate that at least several such incipient events have occurred. A study of fossil dogs and wolves in Belgium, Ukraine, and Russia tentatively dates domestication from 14,000 years ago to more than 31,700 years ago.[8] Another recent study has found support for claims of dog domestication between 14,000 and 16,000 years ago, with a range between 9,000 and 34,000 years ago, depending on mutation rate assumptions.[9] Dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals. This impact on human society has given them the nickname "man's best friend" in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs are also a source of meat.[10][11] In 2001, there were estimated to be 400 million dogs in the world.[12]\u000a\u000aMost breeds of dog are at most a few hundred years old, having been artificially selected for particular morphologies and behaviors by people for specific functional roles. Through this selective breeding, the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal.[13] For example, height measured to the withers ranges from 15.2 centimetres (6.0 in) in the Chihuahua to about 76 cm (30 in) in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called "blue") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark ("red" or "chocolate") in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth.[14] It is common for most breeds to shed this coat.\u000a\u000aDog is the common use term that refers to members of the subspecies Canis lupus familiaris (canis, "dog"; lupus, "wolf"; familiaris, "of a household" or "domestic"). The term can also be used to refer to a wider range of related species, such as the members of the genus Canis, or "true dogs", including the wolf, coyote, and jackals, or it can refer to the members of the tribe Canini, which would also include the African wild dog, or it can be used to refer to any member of the family Canidae, which would also include the foxes, bush dog, raccoon dog, and others.[15] Some members of the family have dog in their common names, such as the raccoon dog and the African wild dog. A few animals have dog in their common names but are not canids, such as the prairie dog.\u000a\u000aThe English word dog comes from Middle English dogge, from Old English docga, a "powerful dog breed".[16] The term may possibly derive from Proto-Germanic *dukk\u014dn, represented in Old English finger-docce ("finger-muscle").[17] The word also shows the familiar petname diminutive -ga also seen in frogga "frog", picga "pig", stagga "stag", wicga "beetle, worm", among others.[18] The term dog may ultimately derive from the earliest layer of Proto-Indo-European vocabulary, reflecting the role of the dog as the earliest domesticated animal.[19]\u000a\u000aIn 14th-century England, hound (from Old English: hund) was the general word for all domestic canines, and dog referred to a subtype of hound, a group including the mastiff. It is believed this "dog" type was so common, it eventually became the prototype of the category "hound".[20] By the 16th century, dog had become the general word, and hound had begun to refer only to types used for hunting.[21] Hound, cognate to German Hund, Dutch hond, common Scandinavian hund, and Icelandic hundur, is ultimately derived from the Proto-Indo-European *kwon- "dog", found in Sanskrit kukuur (\u0915\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0915\u0941\u0930),[22] Welsh ci (plural cwn), Latin canis, Greek ký\u014dn, and Lithuanian \u0161uõ.[23]\u000a\u000aIn breeding circles, a male canine is referred to as a dog, while a female is called a bitch (Middle English bicche, from Old English bicce, ultimately from Old Norse bikkja). A group of offspring is a litter. The father of a litter is called the sire, and the mother is called the dam. Offspring are, in general, called pups or puppies, from French poupée, until they are about a year old. The process of birth is whelping, from the Old English word hwelp (cf. German Welpe, Dutch welp, Swedish valpa, Icelandic hvelpur).[24] The term "whelp" can also be used to refer to the young of any canid, or as a (somewhat archaic) alternative to "puppy".\u000a\u000aIn 1753, the father of modern biological taxonomy, Carl Linnaeus, listed among the types of quadrupeds familiar to him, the Latin word for dog, canis. Among the species within this genus, Linnaeus listed the fox, as Canis vulpes, wolves (Canis lupus), and the domestic dog, (Canis canis). In later editions, Linnaeus dropped Canis canis and greatly expanded his list of the Canis genus of quadrupeds, and by 1758 included alongside the foxes, wolves, and jackals and many more terms that are now listed as synonyms for domestic dog, including aegyptius (hairless dog), aquaticus, (water dog), and mustelinus (literally "badger dog"). Among these were two that later experts have been widely used for domestic dogs as a species: Canis domesticus and, most predominantly, Canis familiaris, the "common" or "familiar" dog.[25]\u000a\u000aThe domestic dog was accepted as a species in its own right until overwhelming evidence from behavior, vocalizations, morphology, and molecular biology led to the contemporary scientific understanding that a single species, the gray wolf, is the common ancestor for all breeds of domestic dogs.[26][27][28] In recognition of this fact, the domestic dog was reclassified in 1993 as Canis lupus familiaris, a subspecies of the gray wolf Canis lupus, by the Smithsonian Institution and the American Society of Mammalogists. C. l. familiaris is listed as the name for the taxon that is broadly used in the scientific community and recommended by ITIS, although Canis familiaris is a recognised synonym.[29]\u000a\u000aSince that time, C. domesticus and all taxa referring to domestic dogs or subspecies of dog listed by Linnaeus, Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1792, and Christian Smith in 1839, lost their subspecies status and have been listed as taxonomic synonyms for Canis lupus familiaris.[30]\u000a\u000aDomestic dogs inherited complex behaviors from their wolf ancestors, which would have been pack hunters with complex body language. These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations, and these attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful species on the planet today.[26]\u000a\u000aAlthough experts largely disagree over the details of dog domestication, it is agreed that human interaction played a significant role in shaping the subspecies.[31] Domestication may have occurred initially in separate areas, particularly Siberia and Europe. It is thought that the current lineage of dogs were domesticated between 15,000 years and 8,500 years ago. Shortly after the latest domestication, dogs became ubiquitous in human populations, and spread throughout the world.\u000a\u000aEmigrants from Siberia likely crossed the Bering Strait with dogs in their company, and some experts[32] suggest the use of sled dogs may have been critical to the success of the waves that entered North America roughly 12,000 years ago,[32] although the earliest archaeological evidence of dog-like canids in North America dates from about 9,400 years ago.[33][34] Dogs were an important part of life for the Athabascan population in North America, and were their only domesticated animal. Dogs also carried much of the load in the migration of the Apache and Navajo tribes 1,400 years ago. Use of dogs as pack animals in these cultures often persisted after the introduction of the horse to North America.[35]\u000a\u000aThe current consensus among biologists and archaeologists is that the dating of first domestication is indeterminate,[31][35] although more recent evidence shows isolated domestication events as early as 33,000 years ago.[36][37] There is conclusive evidence the present lineage of dogs genetically diverged from their wolf ancestors at least 15,000 years ago,[38][39][40][41][42] but some believe domestication to have occurred earlier.[31] Evidence is accruing that there were previous domestication events, but that those lineages died out.[43]\u000a\u000aIt is not known whether humans domesticated the wolf as such to initiate dog's divergence from its ancestors, or whether dog's evolutionary path had already taken a different course prior to domestication. For example, it is hypothesized that some wolves gathered around the campsites of paleolithic camps to scavenge refuse, and associated evolutionary pressure developed that favored those who were less frightened by, and keener in approaching, humans.[44]\u000a\u000aThe bulk of the scientific evidence for the evolution of the domestic dog stems from morphological studies of archaeological findings and mitochondrial DNA studies. The divergence date of roughly 15,000 years ago is based in part on archaeological evidence that demonstrates the domestication of dogs occurred more than 15,000 years ago,[26][35] and some genetic evidence indicates the domestication of dogs from their wolf ancestors began in the late Upper Paleolithic close to the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary, between 17,000 and 14,000 years ago.[45] But there is a wide range of other, contradictory findings that make this issue controversial.[citation needed] There are findings beginning currently at 33,000 years ago distinctly placing them as domesticated dogs evidenced not only by shortening of the muzzle but widening as well as crowding of teeth.\u000a\u000aArchaeological evidence suggests that the latest point at which dogs could have diverged from wolves was roughly 15,000 years ago, although it is possible they diverged much earlier.[26] In 2008, a team of international scientists released findings from an excavation at Goyet Cave in Belgium declaring a large, toothy canine existed 31,700 years ago and ate a diet of horse, musk ox and reindeer.[46]\u000a\u000aPrior to this Belgian discovery, the earliest dog bones found were two large skulls from Russia and a mandible from Germany dated from roughly 14,000 years ago.[26][40] Remains of smaller dogs from Natufian cave deposits in the Middle East, including the earliest burial of a human being with a domestic dog, have been dated to around 10,000 to 12,000 years ago.[40][47] There is a great deal of archaeological evidence for dogs throughout Europe and Asia around this period and through the next two thousand years (roughly 8,000 to 10,000 years ago), with specimens uncovered in Germany, the French Alps, and Iraq, and cave paintings in Turkey.[26] The oldest remains of a domesticated dog in the Americas were found in Texas and have been dated to about 9,400 years ago.[48]\u000a\u000aDNA studies have provided a wide range of possible divergence dates, from 15,000 to 40,000 years ago,[40] to as much as 100,000 to 140,000 years ago.[49] These results depend on a number of assumptions.[26] Genetic studies are based on comparisons of genetic diversity between species, and depend on a calibration date. Some estimates of divergence dates from DNA evidence use an estimated wolf\u2013coyote divergence date of roughly 700,000 years ago as a calibration.[50] If this estimate is incorrect, and the actual wolf\u2013coyote divergence is closer to one or two million years ago, or more,[51] than the DNA evidence that supports specific dog\u2013wolf divergence dates would be interpreted very differently.\u000a\u000aFurthermore, it is believed the genetic diversity of wolves has been in decline for the last 200 years, and that the genetic diversity of dogs has been reduced by selective breeding. This could significantly bias DNA analyses to support an earlier divergence date. The genetic evidence for the domestication event occurring in East Asia is also subject to violations of assumptions. These conclusions are based on the location of maximal genetic divergence, and assume hybridization does not occur, and that breeds remain geographically localized. Although these assumptions hold for many species, there is good reason to believe that they do not hold for canines.[26]\u000a\u000aGenetic analyses indicate all dogs are likely descended from a handful of domestication events with a small number of founding females,[26][45] although there is evidence domesticated dogs interbred with local populations of wild wolves on several occasions.[40] Data suggest dogs first diverged from wolves in East Asia, and these domesticated dogs then quickly migrated throughout the world, reaching the North American continent around 8000 BC.[40] The oldest groups of dogs, which show the greatest genetic variability and are the most similar to their wolf ancestors, are primarily Asian and African breeds, including the Basenji, Lhasa Apso, and Siberian Husky.[52] Some breeds thought to be very old, such as the Pharaoh Hound, Ibizan Hound, and Norwegian Elkhound, are now known to have been created more recently.[52]\u000a\u000aA great deal of controversy surrounds the evolutionary framework for the domestication of dogs.[26] Although it is widely claimed that "man domesticated the wolf,"[53] man might not have taken such a proactive role in the process.[26] The nature of the interaction between man and wolf that led to domestication is unknown and controversial. At least three early species of the Homo genus began spreading out of Africa roughly 400,000 years ago, and thus lived for a considerable time in contact with canine species.[26]\u000a\u000aDespite this, there is no evidence of any adaptation of canine species to the presence of the close relatives of modern man. If dogs were domesticated, as believed, roughly 15,000 years ago, the event (or events) would have coincided with a large expansion in human territory and the development of agriculture. This has led some biologists to suggest one of the forces that led to the domestication of dogs was a shift in human lifestyle in the form of established human settlements. Permanent settlements would have coincided with a greater amount of disposable food and would have created a barrier between wild and anthropogenic canine populations.[26]\u000a\u000aIn 2013 Thalmann, Krause and coworkers revised the view that dog ancestors came from East Asia and showed using DNA analysis that "all dogs living today go back to four genetic lineages, all of which originate in Europe." [54] Their data indicated that bonding between humans and dog occurred between 19,000 and 30,000 years ago, likely in the context of hunting.[54] The Zarzian culture, an archaeological culture of late Paleolithic and Mesolithic (18,000-8,000 years BC) in Iraq, Iran, Central Asia is associated with remains of the domesticated dog.[55]\u000a\u000aWolves, and their dog descendants, would have derived significant benefits from living in human camps\u2014more safety, more reliable food, lesser caloric needs, and more chance to breed.[56] They would have benefited from humans' upright gait that gives them larger range over which to see potential predators and prey, as well as color vision that, at least by day, gives humans better visual discrimination.[56] Camp dogs would also have benefitted from human tool use, as in bringing down larger prey and controlling fire for a range of purposes.[56]\u000a\u000aHumans would also have derived enormous benefit from the dogs associated with their camps.[57] For instance, dogs would have improved sanitation by cleaning up food scraps.[57] Dogs may have provided warmth, as referred to in the Australian Aboriginal expression "three dog night" (an exceptionally cold night), and they would have alerted the camp to the presence of predators or strangers, using their acute hearing to provide an early warning.[57]\u000a\u000aAnthropologists believe the most significant benefit would have been the use of dogs' sensitive sense of smell to assist with the hunt.[57] The relationship between the presence of a dog and success in the hunt is often mentioned as a primary reason for the domestication of the wolf, and a 2004 study of hunter groups with and without a dog gives quantitative support to the hypothesis that the benefits of cooperative hunting was an important factor in wolf domestication.[58]\u000a\u000aThe cohabitation of dogs and humans would have greatly improved the chances of survival for early human groups, and the domestication of dogs may have been one of the key forces that led to human success.[59]\u000a\u000a"The most widespread form of interspecies bonding occurs between humans and dogs"[57] and the keeping of dogs as companions, particularly by elites, has a long history.[60] (As a possible example, at the Natufian culture site of Ain Mallaha in Israel, dated to 12,000 BC, the remains of an elderly human and a four-to-five-month-old puppy were found buried together).[61] However, pet dog populations grew significantly after World War II as suburbanization increased.[60] In the 1950s and 1960s, dogs were kept outside more often than they tend to be today[62] (using the expression "in the doghouse" to describe exclusion from the group signifies the distance between the doghouse and the home) and were still primarily functional, acting as a guard, children's playmate, or walking companion. From the 1980s, there have been changes in the role of the pet dog, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians.[63] People and dogs have become increasingly integrated and implicated in each other's lives,[64] to the point where pet dogs actively shape the way a family and home are experienced.[65]\u000a\u000aThere have been two major trends in the changing status of pet dogs. The first has been the 'commodification' of the dog, shaping it to conform to human expectations of personality and behaviour.[65] The second has been the broadening of the concept of the family and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices.[65]\u000a\u000aThere are a vast range of commodity forms available to transform a pet dog into an ideal companion.[66] The list of goods, services and places available is enormous: from dog perfumes, couture, furniture and housing, to dog groomers, therapists, trainers and caretakers, dog cafes, spas, parks and beaches, and dog hotels, airlines and cemeteries.[66] While dog training as an organized activity can be traced back to the 18th century, in the last decades of the 20th century it became a high profile issue as many normal dog behaviors such as barking, jumping up, digging, rolling in dung, fighting, and urine marking[further explanation needed] became increasingly incompatible with the new role of a pet dog.[67] Dog training books, classes and television programs proliferated as the process of commodifying the pet dog continued.[68]\u000a\u000aThe majority of contemporary people with dogs describe their pet as part of the family,[65] although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog\u2013human family as a pack.[65] A dominance model of dog\u2013human relationships has been promoted by some dog trainers, such as on the television program Dog Whisperer. However it has been disputed that "trying to achieve status" is characteristic of dog\u2013human interactions.[69] Pet dogs play an active role in family life; for example, a study of conversations in dog\u2013human families showed how family members use the dog as a resource, talking to the dog, or talking through the dog, to mediate their interactions with each other.[70]\u000a\u000aAnother study of dogs' roles in families showed many dogs have set tasks or routines undertaken as family members, the most common of which was helping with the washing-up by licking the plates in the dishwasher, and bringing in the newspaper from the lawn.[65] Increasingly, human family members are engaging in activities centered on the perceived needs and interests of the dog, or in which the dog is an integral partner, such as Dog Dancing and Doga.[66]\u000a\u000aAccording to statistics published by the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association in the National Pet Owner Survey in 2009\u20132010, it is estimated there are 77.5 million people with pet dogs in the United States.[71] The same survey shows nearly 40% of American households own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% two dogs and nearly 9% more than two dogs. There does not seem to be any gender preference among dogs as pets, as the statistical data reveal an equal number of female and male dog pets. Yet, although several programs are undergoing to promote pet adoption, less than a fifth of the owned dogs come from a shelter.\u000a\u000aThe latest study using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to humans and dogs together proved that dogs have same response of voices and use the same parts of brain as humans and made dogs understand of emotional human voices, made the dogs as friendly social pets to humans.[72]\u000a\u000aDogs have lived and worked with humans in so many roles that they have earned the unique nickname, "man's best friend",[73] a phrase used in other languages as well. They have been bred for herding livestock,[74] hunting (e.g. pointers and hounds),[75] rodent control,[3] guarding, helping fishermen with nets, detection dogs, and pulling loads, in addition to their roles as companions.[3] In 1957, a husky-terrier mix named Laika became the first animal to orbit the Earth.[76][77]\u000a\u000aService dogs such as guide dogs, utility dogs, assistance dogs, hearing dogs, and psychological therapy dogs provide assistance to individuals with physical or mental disabilities.[78][79] Some dogs owned by epileptics have been shown to alert their handler when the handler shows signs of an impending seizure, sometimes well in advance of onset, allowing the guardian to seek safety, medication, or medical care.[80]\u000a\u000aDogs included in human activities in terms of helping out humans are usually called working dogs. Dogs of several breeds are considered working dogs. Some working dog breeds include Akita, Alaskan Malamute, Anatolian Shepherd Dog, Bernese Mountain Dog, Black Russian Terrier, Boxer, Bullmastiff, Doberman Pinscher, Dogue de Bordeaux, German Pinscher, German Shepherd,[81] Giant Schnauzer, Great Dane, Great Pyrenees, Great Swiss Mountain Dog, Komondor, Kuvasz, Mastiff, Neapolitan Mastiff, Newfoundland, Portuguese Water Dog, Rottweiler, Saint Bernard, Samoyed, Siberian Husky, Standard Schnauzer, and Tibetan Mastiff.\u000a\u000aPeople often enter their dogs in competitions[82] such as breed-conformation shows or sports, including racing, sledding and agility competitions.\u000a\u000aIn conformation shows, also referred to as breed shows, a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed type as described in the breed standard. As the breed standard only deals with the externally observable qualities of the dog (such as appearance, movement, and temperament), separately tested qualities (such as ability or health) are not part of the judging in conformation shows.\u000a\u000aDog meat is consumed in some East Asian countries, including Korea, China, and Vietnam, a practice that dates back to antiquity.[83] It is estimated that 13\u201316 million dogs are killed and consumed in Asia every year.[84] The BBC claims that, in 1999, more than 6,000 restaurants served soups made from dog meat in South Korea.[85] In Korea, the primary dog breed raised for meat, the nureongi (\ub204\ub801\uc774), differs from those breeds raised for pets that Koreans may keep in their homes.[86]\u000a\u000aThe most popular Korean dog dish is gaejang-guk (also called bosintang), a spicy stew meant to balance the body's heat during the summer months; followers of the custom claim this is done to ensure good health by balancing one's gi, or vital energy of the body. A 19th century version of gaejang-guk explains that the dish is prepared by boiling dog meat with scallions and chili powder. Variations of the dish contain chicken and bamboo shoots. While the dishes are still popular in Korea with a segment of the population, dog is not as widely consumed as beef, chicken, and pork.[87]\u000a\u000aA CNN report in China dated March 2010 includes an interview with a dog meat vendor who stated that most of the dogs that are available for selling to restaurants are raised in special farms but that there is always a chance that a sold dog is someone's lost pet, although dog pet breeds are not considered edible.[88]\u000a\u000aOther cultures, such as Polynesia and pre-Columbian Mexico, also consumed dog meat in their history. However, Western, South Asian, African, and Middle Eastern cultures, in general, regard consumption of dog meat as taboo. In some places, however, such as in rural areas of Poland, dog fat is believed to have medicinal properties\u2014being good for the lungs for instance.[89] Dog meat is also consumed in some parts of Switzerland.[90]\u000a\u000aIt is estimated that 4.7 million people are bitten by dogs each year.[91] In the 1980s and 1990s the US averaged 17 fatalities per year, while in the 2000s this has increased to 26.[92] 77% of dog bites are from the pet of family or friends, and 50% of attacks occur on the property of the dog's legal owner.[92]\u000a\u000aA Colorado study found bites in children were less severe than bites in adults.[93] The incidence of dog bites in the US is 12.9 per 10,000 inhabitants, but for boys aged 5 to 9, the incidence rate is 60.7 per 10,000. Moreover, children have a much higher chance to be bitten in the face or neck.[94] Sharp claws with powerful muscles behind them can lacerate flesh in a scratch that can lead to serious infections.[95]\u000a\u000aIn the UK between 2003 and 2004, there were 5,868 dog attacks on humans, resulting in 5,770 working days lost in sick leave.[96]\u000a\u000aIn the United States, cats and dogs are a factor in more than 86,000 falls each year.[97] It has been estimated around 2% of dog-related injuries treated in UK hospitals are domestic accidents. The same study found that while dog involvement in road traffic accidents was difficult to quantify, dog-associated road accidents involving injury more commonly involved two-wheeled vehicles.[98]\u000a\u000aToxocara canis (dog roundworm) eggs in dog feces can cause toxocariasis. In the United States, about 10,000 cases of Toxocara infection are reported in humans each year, and almost 14% of the U.S. population is infected.[99] In Great Britain, 24% of soil samples taken from public parks contained T. canis eggs.[100] Untreated toxocariasis can cause retinal damage and decreased vision.[100] Dog feces can also contain hookworms that cause cutaneous larva migrans in humans.[101][102][103][104]\u000a\u000aThe scientific evidence is mixed as to whether companionship of a dog can enhance human physical health and psychological wellbeing.[105] Studies suggesting that there are benefits to physical health and psychological wellbeing[106] have been criticised for being poorly controlled,[107] and finding that "[t]he health of elderly people is related to their health habits and social supports but not to their ownership of, or attachment to, a companion animal." Earlier studies have shown that people who keep pet dogs or cats exhibit better mental and physical health than those who do not, making fewer visits to the doctor and being less likely to be on medication than non-guardians.[108]\u000a\u000aA 2005 paper states "recent research has failed to support earlier findings that pet ownership is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, a reduced use of general practitioner services, or any psychological or physical benefits on health for community dwelling older people. Research has, however, pointed to significantly less absenteeism from school through sickness among children who live with pets."[105] In one study, new guardians reported a highly significant reduction in minor health problems during the first month following pet acquisition, and this effect was sustained in those with dogs through to the end of the study.[109]\u000a\u000aIn addition, people with pet dogs took considerably more physical exercise than those with cats and those without pets. The group without pets exhibited no statistically significant changes in health or behaviour. The results provide evidence that keeping pets may have positive effects on human health and behaviour, and that for guardians of dogs these effects are relatively long-term.[109] Pet guardianship has also been associated with increased coronary artery disease survival, with human guardians being significantly less likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who did not own dogs.[110]\u000a\u000aThe health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, and not solely from having dogs as pets. For example, when in the presence of a pet dog, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral, and psychological indicators of anxiety.[111] Other health benefits are gained from exposure to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which, according to the hygiene hypothesis, can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases. The benefits of contact with a dog also include social support, as dogs are able to not only provide companionship and social support themselves, but also to act as facilitators of social interactions between humans.[112] One study indicated that wheelchair users experience more positive social interactions with strangers when they are accompanied by a dog than when they are not.[113]\u000a\u000aThe practice of using dogs and other animals as a part of therapy dates back to the late 18th century, when animals were introduced into mental institutions to help socialize patients with mental disorders.[114] Animal-assisted intervention research has shown that animal-assisted therapy with a dog can increase social behaviors, such as smiling and laughing, among people with Alzheimer's disease.[115] One study demonstrated that children with ADHD and conduct disorders who participated in an education program with dogs and other animals showed increased attendance, increased knowledge and skill objectives, and decreased antisocial and violent behavior compared to those who were not in an animal-assisted program.[116]\u000a\u000aEvery year, between 6 and 8 million dogs and cats enter US animal shelters.[117] The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) estimates that approximately 3 to 4 million of those dogs and cats are euthanized yearly in the United States.[118] However, the percentage of dogs in US animal shelters that are eventually adopted and removed from the shelters by their new legal owners has increased since the mid-1990s from around 25% to a 2012 average of 40% among reporting shelters[119] (and many shelters reporting 60\u201375%).[120]\u000a\u000aDomestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[3] Modern dog breeds show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal. Nevertheless, their morphology is based on that of their wild ancestors, gray wolves.[3] Dogs are predators and scavengers, and like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing.\u000a\u000aDogs are highly variable in height and weight. The smallest known adult dog was a Yorkshire Terrier, that stood only 6.3 cm (2.5 in) at the shoulder, 9.5 cm (3.7 in) in length along the head-and-body, and weighed only 113 grams (4.0 oz). The largest known dog was an English Mastiff which weighed 155.6 kg (343 lb) and was 250 cm (98 in) from the snout to the tail.[121] The tallest dog is a Great Dane that stands 106.7 cm (42.0 in) at the shoulder.[122]\u000a\u000aLike most mammals, dogs are dichromats and have color vision equivalent to red\u2013green color blindness in humans (deuteranopia).[123][124][125][126] So, dogs can see blue and yellow, but have difficulty differentiating red and green because they only have two spectral types of cone photoreceptor, while normal humans have three. And dogs use color instead of brightness to differentiate light or dark blue/yellow.[127][128][129][130] Dogs are less sensitive to differences in grey shades than humans and also can detect brightness at about half the accuracy of humans.[131]\u000a\u000aThe dog's visual system has evolved to aid proficient hunting.[123] While a dog's visual acuity is poor (that of a poodle's has been estimated to translate to a Snellen rating of 20/75[123]), their visual discrimination for moving objects is very high; dogs have been shown to be able to discriminate between humans (e.g., identifying their human guardian) at a range of between 800 and 900 m, however this range decreases to 500\u2013600 m if the object is stationary.[123]\u000a\u000aDogs have a temporal resolution of between 60 and 70 Hz, which explains why many dogs struggle to watch television, as most such modern screens are optimized for humans at 50\u201360 Hz.[131] Dogs can detect a change in movement that exists in a single diopter of space within their eye. Humans, by comparison, require a change of between 10 and 20 diopters to detect movement.[132][133]\u000a\u000aAs crepuscular hunters, dogs often rely on their vision in low light situations: They have very large pupils, a high density of rods in the fovea, an increased flicker rate, and a tapetum lucidum.[123] The tapetum is a reflective surface behind the retina that reflects light to give the photoreceptors a second chance to catch the photons. There is also a relationship between body size and overall diameter of the eye. A range of 9.5 and 11.6 mm can be found between various breeds of dogs. This 20% variance can be substantial and is associated as an adaptation toward superior night vision.[134]\u000a\u000aThe eyes of different breeds of dogs have different shapes, dimensions, and retina configurations.[135] Many long-nosed breeds have a "visual streak"\u2014a wide foveal region that runs across the width of the retina and gives them a very wide field of excellent vision. Some long-muzzled breeds, in particular, the sighthounds, have a field of vision up to 270° (compared to 180° for humans). Short-nosed breeds, on the other hand, have an "area centralis": a central patch with up to three times the density of nerve endings as the visual streak, giving them detailed sight much more like a human's. Some broad-headed breeds with short noses have a field of vision similar to that of humans.[124][125]\u000a\u000aMost breeds have good vision, but some show a genetic predisposition for myopia \u2013 such as Rottweilers, with which one out of every two has been found to be myopic.[123] Dogs also have a greater divergence of the eye axis than humans, enabling them to rotate their pupils farther in any direction. The divergence of the eye axis of dogs ranges from 12\u201325° depending on the breed.[132]\u000a\u000aExperimentation has proven that dogs can distinguish between complex visual images such as that of a cube or a prism. Dogs also show attraction to static visual images such as the silhouette of a dog on a screen, their own reflections, or videos of dogs; however, their interest declines sharply once they are unable to make social contact with the image.[136]\u000a\u000aThe frequency range of dog hearing is approximately 40 Hz to 60,000 Hz,[137] which means that dogs can detect sounds far beyond the upper limit of the human auditory spectrum.[125][137][138] In addition, dogs have ear mobility, which allows them to rapidly pinpoint the exact location of a sound.[139] Eighteen or more muscles can tilt, rotate, raise, or lower a dog's ear. A dog can identify a sound's location much faster than a human can, as well as hear sounds at four times the distance.[139]\u000a\u000aWhile the human brain is dominated by a large visual cortex, the dog brain is dominated by an olfactory cortex.[123] The olfactory bulb in dogs is roughly forty times bigger than the olfactory bulb in humans, relative to total brain size, with 125 to 220 million smell-sensitive receptors.[123] The bloodhound exceeds this standard with nearly 300 million receptors.[123]\u000a\u000aConsequently, it has been estimated that dogs, in general, have an olfactory sense ranging from one hundred thousand to one million times more sensitive than a human's. In some dog breeds, such as bloodhounds, the olfactory sense may be up to 100 million times greater than a human's.[140] The wet nose, or rhinarium, is essential for determining the direction of the air current containing the smell. Cold receptors in the skin are sensitive to the cooling of the skin by evaporation of the moisture by air currents.[141]\u000a\u000aThe coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "double" being common with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or "single", with the topcoat only.\u000a\u000aDomestic dogs often display the remnants of countershading, a common natural camouflage pattern. A countershaded animal will have dark coloring on its upper surfaces and light coloring below,[142] which reduces its general visibility. Thus, many breeds will have an occasional "blaze", stripe, or "star" of white fur on their chest or underside.[143]\u000a\u000aThere are many different shapes for dog tails: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or cork-screw. As with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be important in getting along with others. In some hunting dogs, however, the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries.[144] In some breeds, such as the Braque du Bourbonnais, puppies can be born with a short tail or no tail at all.[145]\u000a\u000aWhile all dogs are genetically very similar,[40] natural selection and selective breeding have reinforced certain characteristics in certain populations of dogs, giving rise to dog types and dog breeds. Dog types are broad categories based on function, genetics, or characteristics.[146] Dog breeds are groups of animals that possess a set of inherited characteristics that distinguishes them from other animals within the same species. Modern dog breeds are non-scientific classifications of dogs kept by modern kennel clubs.\u000a\u000aPurebred dogs of one breed are genetically distinguishable from purebred dogs of other breeds,[52] but the means by which kennel clubs classify dogs is unsystematic. Systematic analyses of the dog genome has revealed only four major types of dogs that can be said to be statistically distinct.[52] These include the "old world dogs" (e.g., Malamute and Shar Pei), "Mastiff"-type (e.g., English Mastiff), "herding"-type (e.g., Border Collie), and "all others" (also called "modern"- or "hunting"-type).[52][147]\u000a\u000aDogs are susceptible to various diseases, ailments, and poisons, some of which can affect humans. To defend against many common diseases, dogs are often vaccinated.\u000a\u000aThere are many household plants that are poisonous to dogs, begonia and aloe vera.[148] Poinsettia is often claimed to be toxic but this is untrue. The LD50 for rats was determined to be greater than 25g/kg.[149] This would mean that a 50 pound dog would have to eat 500-600 leaves to have a 50% chance of death.\u000a\u000aSome breeds of dogs are prone to certain genetic ailments such as elbow or hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, pulmonic stenosis, cleft palate, and trick knees. Two serious medical conditions particularly affecting dogs are pyometra, affecting unspayed females of all types and ages, and bloat, which affects the larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions, and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as fleas, ticks, and mites, as well as hookworm, tapeworm, roundworm, and heartworm.\u000a\u000aDogs are highly susceptible to theobromine poisoning, typically from ingestion of chocolate. Theobromine is toxic to dogs because, although the dog's metabolism is capable of breaking down the chemical, the process is so slow that even small amounts of chocolate can be fatal, especially dark chocolate.\u000a\u000aDogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans, including diabetes, dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis.[150]\u000a\u000aThe typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but for most the median longevity, the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive, ranges from 10 to 13 years.[151][152][153][154] Individual dogs may live well beyond the median of their breed.\u000a\u000aThe breed with the shortest lifespan (among breeds for which there is a questionnaire survey with a reasonable sample size) is the Dogue de Bordeaux, with a median longevity of about 5.2 years, but several breeds, including Miniature Bull Terriers, Bloodhounds, and Irish Wolfhounds are nearly as short-lived, with median longevities of 6 to 7 years.[154]\u000a\u000aThe longest-lived breeds, including Toy Poodles, Japanese Spitz, Border Terriers, and Tibetan Spaniels, have median longevities of 14 to 15 years.[154] The median longevity of mixed-breed dogs, taken as an average of all sizes, is one or more years longer than that of purebred dogs when all breeds are averaged.[152][153][154][155] The dog widely reported to be the longest-lived is "Bluey", who died in 1939 and was claimed to be 29.5 years old at the time of his death; however, the Bluey record is anecdotal and unverified.[156] On 5 December 2011, Pusuke, the world's oldest living dog recognized by Guinness Book of World Records, died aged 26 years and 9 months.[157]\u000a\u000aAlthough wild dogs, like wolves, are apex predators, they can be killed in territory disputes with wild animals.[158] Furthermore, in areas where both dogs and other large predators live, dogs can be a major food source for big cats or canines. Reports from Croatia indicate wolves kill dogs more frequently than they kill sheep. Wolves in Russia apparently limit feral dog populations. In Wisconsin, more compensation has been paid for dog losses than livestock.[158] Some wolf pairs have been reported to prey on dogs by having one wolf lure the dog out into heavy brush where the second animal waits in ambush.[159] In some instances, wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when attacking dogs, to the extent that they[which?] have to be beaten off or killed.[160]\u000a\u000aCoyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs. Leopards in particular are known to have a predilection for dogs, and have been recorded to kill and consume them regardless of the dog's size or ferocity.[161] Tigers in Manchuria, Indochina, Indonesia, and Malaysia are reputed to kill dogs with the same vigor as leopards.[162] Striped Hyenas are major predators of village dogs in Turkmenistan, India, and the Caucasus.[163] Reptiles such as alligators and pythons have been known to kill and eat dogs.\u000a\u000aDespite their descent from wolves and classification as Carnivora, dogs are variously described in scholarly and other writings as carnivores[164][165] or omnivores.[3][166][167][168] Unlike obligate carnivores, such as the cat family with its shorter small intestine, dogs can adapt to a wide-ranging diet, and are not dependent on meat-specific protein nor a very high level of protein in order to fulfill their basic dietary requirements. Dogs will healthily digest a variety of foods, including vegetables and grains, and can consume a large proportion of these in their diet.[3] Compared to their wolf ancestors, dogs have adaptations in genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet.[169]\u000a\u000aA number of common human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs, including chocolate solids (theobromine poisoning), onion and garlic (thiosulphate, sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning),[170] grapes and raisins, macadamia nuts, xylitol,[171] as well as various plants and other potentially ingested materials.[172][173] The nicotine in tobacco can also be dangerous. Dogs can get it by scavenging in garbage or ashtrays; eating cigars and cigarettes. Signs can be vomiting of large amounts (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea. Some other signs are abdominal pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or death. To solve, soothe the stomach irritation by giving charcoal tablets. For severe signs, get immediate veterinary attention.[174]\u000a\u000aIn domestic dogs, sexual maturity begins to happen around age six to twelve months for both males and females,[3][175] although this can be delayed until up to two years old for some large breeds. This is the time at which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle. They will experience subsequent estrous cycles biannually, during which the body prepares for pregnancy. At the peak of the cycle, females will come into estrus, being mentally and physically receptive to copulation.[3] Because the ova survive and are capable of being fertilized for a week after ovulation, it is possible for a female to mate with more than one male.[3]\u000a\u000aDogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after fertilization,[3][178] with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation can vary. An average litter consists of about six puppies,[179] though this number may vary widely based on the breed of dog. In general, toy dogs produce from one to four puppies in each litter, while much larger breeds may average as many as twelve.\u000a\u000aSome dog breeds have acquired traits through selective breeding that interfere with reproduction. Male French Bulldogs, for instance, are incapable of mounting the female. For many dogs of this breed, the female must be artificially inseminated in order to reproduce.[180]\u000a\u000aNeutering refers to the sterilization of animals, usually by removal of the male's testicles or the female's ovaries and uterus, in order to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce sex drive. Because of the overpopulation of dogs in some countries, many animal control agencies, such as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered, so that they do not have undesired puppies that may have to later be euthanized.[181]\u000a\u000aAccording to the Humane Society of the United States, 3\u20134 million dogs and cats are put down each year in the United States and many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes. Spaying or castrating dogs helps keep overpopulation down.[182] Local humane societies, SPCAs, and other animal protection organizations urge people to neuter their pets and to adopt animals from shelters instead of purchasing them.\u000a\u000aNeutering reduces problems caused by hypersexuality, especially in male dogs.[183] Spayed female dogs are less likely to develop some forms of cancer, affecting mammary glands, ovaries, and other reproductive organs.[184] However, neutering increases the risk of urinary incontinence in female dogs,[185] and prostate cancer in males,[186] as well as osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, cruciate ligament rupture, obesity, and diabetes mellitus in either sex.[187]\u000a\u000aBy the age of four weeks, the dog has developed the majority of its vocalizations.[188] The dog is the most vocal canid and is unique in its tendency to bark in a myriad of situations.[188]\u000a\u000aBarking appears to have little more communication functions than excitement, fighting, the presence of a human, or simply because other dogs are barking.[188] Subtler signs such as discreet bodily and facial movements, body odors, whines, yelps, and growls are the main sources of actual communication.[188] The majority of these subtle communication techniques are employed at a close proximity to another, but for long-range communication only barking and howling are employed.[188]\u000a\u000aThe domestic dog has a predisposition to exhibit a social intelligence that is uncommon in the animal world.[123] Dogs are capable of learning in a number of ways, such as through simple reinforcement (e.g., classical or operant conditioning) and by observation.[123]\u000a\u000aDogs go through a series of stages of cognitive development. As with humans, the understanding that objects not being actively perceived still remain in existence (called object permanence) is not present at birth. It develops as the young dog learns to interact intentionally with objects around it, at roughly 8 weeks of age.[123]\u000a\u000aPuppies learn behaviors quickly by following examples set by experienced dogs.[123] This form of intelligence is not peculiar to those tasks dogs have been bred to perform, but can be generalized to myriad abstract problems. For example, Dachshund puppies that watched an experienced dog pull a cart by tugging on an attached piece of ribbon in order to get a reward from inside the cart learned the task fifteen times faster than those left to solve the problem on their own.[123][190]\u000a\u000aDogs can also learn by mimicking human behaviors. In one study, puppies were presented with a box, and shown that, when a handler pressed a lever, a ball would roll out of the box. The handler then allowed the puppy to play with the ball, making it an intrinsic reward. The pups were then allowed to interact with the box. Roughly three quarters of the puppies subsequently touched the lever, and over half successfully released the ball, compared to only 6% in a control group that did not watch the human manipulate the lever.[191] Another study found that handing an object between experimenters who then used the object's name in a sentence successfully taught an observing dog each object's name, allowing the dog to subsequently retrieve the item.[192]\u000a\u000aDogs also demonstrate sophisticated social cognition by associating behavioral cues with abstract meanings.[123] One such class of social cognition involves the understanding that others are conscious agents. Research has shown that dogs are capable of interpreting subtle social cues, and appear to recognize when a human or dog's attention is focused on them. To test this, researchers devised a task in which a reward was hidden underneath one of two buckets. The experimenter then attempted to communicate with the dog to indicate the location of the reward by using a wide range of signals: tapping the bucket, pointing to the bucket, nodding to the bucket, or simply looking at the bucket.[193] The results showed that domestic dogs were better than chimpanzees, wolves, and human infants at this task, and even young puppies with limited exposure to humans performed well.[123]\u000a\u000aPsychology research has shown that humans' gaze instinctively moves to the left in order to watch the right side of a person's face, which is related to use of right hemisphere brain for facial recognition, including human facial emotions. Research at the University of Lincoln (2008) shows that dogs share this instinct when meeting a human being, and only when meeting a human being (i.e., not other animals or other dogs). As such they are the only non-primate species known to do so.[194][195]\u000a\u000aStanley Coren, an expert on dog psychology, states that these results demonstrated the social cognition of dogs can exceed that of even our closest genetic relatives, and that this capacity is a recent genetic acquisition that distinguishes the dog from its ancestor, the wolf.[123] Studies have also investigated whether dogs engaged in partnered play change their behavior depending on the attention-state of their partner.[196] Those studies showed that play signals were only sent when the dog was holding the attention of its partner. If the partner was distracted, the dog instead engaged in attention-getting behavior before sending a play signal.[196]\u000a\u000aCoren has also argued that dogs demonstrate a sophisticated theory of mind by engaging in deception, which he supports with a number of anecdotes, including one example wherein a dog hid a stolen treat by sitting on it until the rightful owner of the treat left the room.[123] Although this could have been accidental, Coren suggests that the thief understood that the treat's owner would be unable to find the treat if it were out of view. Together, the empirical data and anecdotal evidence points to dogs possessing at least a limited form of theory of mind.[123][196] Similar research has been performed by Brian Hare of Duke University, who has shown that dogs outperform both great apes as well as wolves raised by humans in reading human communicative signals.[197][198]\u000a\u000aA study found a third of dogs suffered from anxiety when separated from others.[199]\u000a\u000aA border collie named Chaser has learned the names for 1,022 toys after three years of training, so many that her trainers have had to mark the names of the objects lest they forget themselves. This is higher than Rico, another border collie who could remember at least 200 objects.[200]\u000a\u000aAlthough dogs have been the subject of a great deal of behaviorist psychology (e.g. Pavlov's dog), they do not enter the world with a psychological "blank slate".[123] Rather, dog behavior is affected by genetic factors as well as environmental factors.[123] Domestic dogs exhibit a number of behaviors and predispositions that were inherited from wolves.[123]\u000a\u000aThe Gray Wolf is a social animal that has evolved a sophisticated means of communication and social structure. The domestic dog has inherited some of these predispositions, but many of the salient characteristics in dog behavior have been largely shaped by selective breeding by humans. Thus some of these characteristics, such as the dog's highly developed social cognition, are found only in primitive forms in grey wolves.[193]\u000a\u000aThe existence and nature of personality traits in dogs have been studied (15329 dogs of 164 different breeds) and five consistent and stable "narrow traits" identified, described as playfulness, curiosity/fearlessness, chase-proneness, sociability and aggressiveness. A further higher order axis for shyness\u2013boldness was also identified.[201][202]\u000a\u000aThe average sleep time of a dog is said to be 10.1 hours per day.[203] Like humans, dogs have two main types of sleep: Slow-wave sleep, then Rapid eye movement sleep, the state in which dreams occur.[204]\u000a\u000aDogs prefer, when they are off the leash and Earth's magnetic field is calm, to urinate and defecate with their bodies aligned on a north-south axis.[205]\u000a\u000aA new study in Budapest, Hungary, has found that dogs are able to tell how big another dog is just by listening to its growl. A specific growl is used by dogs to protect their food. The research also shows that dogs do not lie about their size, and this is the first time research has shown animals can determine another's size by the sound it makes. The test, using images of many kinds of dogs, showed a small and big dog and played a growl. The result showed that 20 of the 24 test dogs looked at the image of the appropriately sized dog first and looked at it longest.[206]\u000a\u000aCompared to equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 20% smaller skulls, 30% smaller brains,[207] as well as proportionately smaller teeth than other canid species.[208] Dogs require fewer calories to function than wolves. It is thought by certain experts that the dog's limp ears are a result of atrophy of the jaw muscles.[208] The skin of domestic dogs tends to be thicker than that of wolves, with some Inuit tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather.[208]\u000a\u000aDogs tend to be poorer than wolves at observational learning, being more responsive to instrumental conditioning.[208] Feral dogs show little of the complex social structure or dominance hierarchy present in wolf packs. For example, unlike wolves, the dominant alpha pairs of a feral dog pack do not force the other members to wait for their turn on a meal when scavenging off a dead ungulate as the whole family is free to join in. For dogs, other members of their kind are of no help in locating food items, and are more like competitors.[208]\u000a\u000aFeral dogs are primarily scavengers, with studies showing that unlike their wild cousins, they are poor ungulate hunters, having little impact on wildlife populations where they are sympatric. However, feral dogs have been reported to be effective hunters of reptiles in the Galápagos Islands,[209] and free ranging pet dogs are more prone to predatory behavior toward wild animals.\u000a\u000aDomestic dogs can be monogamous.[210] Breeding in feral packs can be, but does not have to be restricted to a dominant alpha pair (such things also occur in wolf packs).[211] Male dogs are unusual among canids by the fact that they mostly seem to play no role in raising their puppies, and do not kill the young of other females to increase their own reproductive success.[209] Some sources say that dogs differ from wolves and most other large canid species by the fact that they do not regurgitate food for their young, nor the young of other dogs in the same territory.[208]\u000a\u000aHowever, this difference was not observed in all domestic dogs. Regurgitating of food by the females for the young as well as care for the young by the males has been observed in domestic dogs, dingos as well as in other feral or semi-feral dogs. Regurgitating of food by the females and direct choosing of only one mate has been observed even in those semi-feral dogs of direct domestic dog ancestry. Also regurgitating of food by males has been observed in free-ranging domestic dogs.[210][212]\u000a\u000aDogs display much greater tractability than tame wolves, and are, in general, much more responsive to coercive techniques involving fear, aversive stimuli, and force than wolves, which are most responsive toward positive conditioning and rewards.[213] Unlike tame wolves, dogs tend to respond more to voice than hand signals.[214]\u000a\u000aIn mythology, dogs often serve as pets or as watchdogs.[215]\u000a\u000aIn Greek mythology, Cerberus is a three-headed watchdog who guards the gates of Hades.[215] In Norse mythology, a bloody, four-eyed dog called Garmr guards Helheim.[215] In Persian mythology, two four-eyed dogs guard the Chinvat Bridge.[215] In Philippine mythology, Kimat who is the pet of Tadaklan, god of thunder, is responsible for lightning. In Welsh mythology, Annwn is guarded by C\u0175n Annwn.[215]\u000a\u000aIn Hindu mythology, Yama, the god of death owns two watch dogs who have four eyes. They are said to watch over the gates of Naraka.[216] Hunter god Muthappan from North Malabar region of Kerala has hunting Dog as his mount. Dogs are found in and out of the Muthappan Temple and offerings at the shrine take the form of bronze dog figurines.[217]\u000a\u000aIn Judaism and Islam, dogs are viewed as unclean scavengers.[215] In Christianity, dogs represent faithfulness.[215] In Asian countries such as China, Korea, and Japan, dogs are viewed as kind protectors.[215] The role of the dog in Chinese mythology includes a position as one of the twelve animals which cyclically represent years (the zodiacal dog).

VLed Zeppelin, British rock band that was extremely popular in the 1970s. Although their musical style was diverse, they came to be well known for their influence on the development of heavy metal. The members were Jimmy Page (b. January 9, 1944, Heston, Middlesex, England), Robert Plant (b. August 20, 1948, West Bromwich, West Midlands), John Paul Jones (original name John Baldwin; b. January 3, 1946, Sidcup, Kent), and John Bonham (b. May 31, 1948, Redditch, Hereford and Worcester\u2014d. September 25, 1980, Windsor, Berkshire).\u000a\u000aInitially called the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin was formed in 1968 by Jimmy Page, the final lead guitarist for the legendary British blues band the Yardbirds. Bassist and keyboard player Jones, like Page, was a veteran studio musician; vocalist Plant and drummer Bonham came from little-known provincial bands. The group was influenced by various kinds of music, including early rock and roll, psychedelic rock, blues, folk, Celtic, Indian, and Arabic music. Although acoustic and folk-based music was part of the band\u2019s repertoire from its inception, it was the bottom-heavy, loud, raw, and powerful electric style that gained them their following and notoriety early on; their first two albums included many of the songs that prompted Led Zeppelin\u2019s categorization as a precursor of heavy metal. The heaviness of songs such as \u201c \u201d and \u201c \u201d was created by Bonham\u2019s enormous drum sound and through Page\u2019s production techniques, in which he emphasized drums and bass, resulting in a sonic spaciousness that has kept the records sounding fresh years after they were made. Page and Jones also wrote most of the band\u2019s music, while Plant contributed lyrics and some musical ideas. Although Page was responsible for the majority of their signature riffs (the short, repeated musical ideas that often structure a song), Jones wrote the riff for the celebrated \u201c \u201d and several other songs. Jones also contributed much to the arrangement of songs. Page\u2019s guitar solos were based primarily on melodic ideas derived from the blues scale (\u201c \u201d is a good example), and he is especially known for creating multiple, simultaneous guitar parts\u2014a kind of guitar orchestra\u2014in such songs as \u201c \u201d and \u201c The Song Remains the Same. \u201d Page is considered one of rock\u2019s guitar heroes, but, because he was more interested in creating a distinctive mood and sound on a recording than in displaying his virtuosity, he frequently chose not to include a guitar solo in Zeppelin songs.\u000a\u000aPlant\u2019s voice rounded out Led Zeppelin\u2019s sound. Exaggerating the vocal style and expressive palette of blues singers such as Howlin\u2019 Wolf and Muddy Waters, Plant created the sound that has defined much hard rock and heavy metal singing: a high range, an abundance of distortion, loud volume, and emotional excess (\u201c \u201d is a classic example). Plant was, however, capable of a broader stylistic range, including tender ballads (\u201c \u201d) and songs showing the influence of Indian and Arabic vocal styles (\u201c \u201d).\u000a\u000aLed Zeppelin\u2019s best-known song is \u201c \u201d; its gentle acoustic beginning eventually builds to an exhilarating climax featuring a lengthy electric guitar solo. This combination of acoustic and electric sections was typical for Page, who from the band\u2019s beginning was interested in juxtaposing what he called \u201clight and shade.\u201d The song appeared on the band\u2019s fourth and most famous album, released untitled, which showed only four runic symbols (intended to represent the band members) on the cover and had the mystical, mythological lyrics to \u201c \u201d printed on the inner sleeve. The sense of mystery and ritual that this created became an important part of the band\u2019s image. They kept their distance from the press and were uninterested in catering to the singles market. Moreover, \u201c \u201d and several other songs were of epic length by rock standards, and concert improvisations stretched some songs to triple the length of their studio versions.\u000a\u000aThanks in part to their manager, Peter Grant, the band enjoyed phenomenal commercial success throughout the 1970s. While Led Zeppelin never received the kind of critical acclaim or mainstream acceptance accorded the Beatles or the Rolling Stones, their influence on rock music has been prodigious. They are regularly cited as the progenitors of both hard rock and heavy metal. Their sound has been imitated by bands from Black Sabbath to Nirvana. They also inspired hard rock bands to include acoustic elements in their music and were among the first to experiment with Indian and North African music. Page\u2019s style\u2014both his solos and riffs\u2014has served as an important model for most rock guitarists, and Bonham is often cited as the model for metal or hard rock drumming.\u000a\u000aLed Zeppelin disbanded in 1980 after Bonham\u2019s accidental death. The group re-formed for short, one-off performances in 1985 (the Live Aid benefit), 1988 (Atlantic Records\u2019 40th anniversary concert), and 1995 (the band\u2019s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame). Much more momentous was the group\u2019s full-blown concert in London in December 2007 to honour Atlantic\u2019s cofounder Ahmet Ertegun, at which Bonham\u2019s son, Jason, played the drums. Although the Recording Academy had honoured Led Zeppelin with a lifetime achievement award in 2005, the group received its first Grammy Award in 2014 for Celebration Day (2012), a live album derived from the 2007 reunion show. In 2012 Led Zeppelin was named a Kennedy Center honoree.

VIndia, country that occupies the greater part of South Asia. It is a constitutional republic consisting of 29 states, each with a substantial degree of control over its own affairs; 6 less fully empowered union territories; and the Delhi national capital territory, which includes New Delhi, India\u2019s capital. With roughly one-sixth of the world\u2019s total population, India is the second most populous country, after China.\u000a\u000aIt is known from archaeological evidence that a highly sophisticated, urbanized culture\u2014the Indus civilization\u2014dominated the northwestern part of the subcontinent from about 2600 to 2000 bce. From that period on, India functioned as a virtually self-contained political and cultural arena, which gave rise to a distinctive tradition that was associated primarily with Hinduism, the roots of which can largely be traced to the Indus civilization. Other religions, notably Buddhism and Jainism, originated in India\u2014though their presence there is now quite small\u2014and throughout the centuries residents of the subcontinent developed a rich intellectual life in such fields as mathematics, astronomy, and architecture.\u000a\u000aThroughout its history, India was intermittently disturbed by incursions from beyond its northern mountain wall. Especially important was the coming of Islam, brought from the northwest by Arab, Turkish, Persian, and other raiders beginning early in the 8th century ce. Eventually, some of these raiders stayed; by the 13th century much of the subcontinent was under Muslim rule, and the number of Muslims steadily increased. Only after the arrival of the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama in 1498 and the subsequent establishment of European maritime supremacy in the region did India become exposed to major external influences arriving by sea, a process that culminated in the decline of the ruling Muslim elite and absorption of the subcontinent within the British Empire.\u000a\u000aDirect administration by the British, which began in 1858, effected a political and economic unification of the subcontinent. When British rule came to an end in 1947, the subcontinent was partitioned along religious lines into two separate countries\u2014India, with a majority of Hindus, and Pakistan, with a majority of Muslims; the eastern portion of Pakistan later split off to form Bangladesh. Many British institutions stayed in place (such as the parliamentary system of government); English continued to be a widely used lingua franca; and India remained within the Commonwealth. Hindi became the official language (and a number of other local languages achieved official status), while a vibrant English-language intelligentsia thrived.\u000a\u000aIndia remains one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world. Apart from its many religions and sects, India is home to innumerable castes and tribes, as well as to more than a dozen major and hundreds of minor linguistic groups from several language families unrelated to one another. Religious minorities, including Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Jains, still account for a significant proportion of the population; collectively, their numbers exceed the populations of all countries except China. Earnest attempts have been made to instill a spirit of nationhood in so varied a population, but tensions between neighbouring groups have remained and at times have resulted in outbreaks of violence. Yet social legislation has done much to alleviate the disabilities previously suffered by formerly \u201cuntouchable\u201d castes, tribal populations, women, and other traditionally disadvantaged segments of society. At independence, India was blessed with several leaders of world stature, most notably Mohandas K. Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, who were able to galvanize the masses at home and bring prestige to India abroad. The country has played an increasing role in global affairs.\u000a\u000aContemporary India\u2019s increasing physical prosperity and cultural dynamism\u2014despite continued domestic challenges and economic inequality\u2014are seen in its well-developed infrastructure and a highly diversified industrial base, in its pool of scientific and engineering personnel (one of the largest in the world), in the pace of its agricultural expansion, and in its rich and vibrant cultural exports of music, literature, and cinema. Though the country\u2019s population remains largely rural, India has three of the most populous and cosmopolitan cities in the world\u2014Mumbai (Bombay), Kolkata (Calcutta), and Delhi. Three other Indian cities\u2014Bangalore (Bengaluru), Chennai (Madras), and Hyderabad\u2014are among the world\u2019s fastest-growing high-technology centres, and most of the world\u2019s major information technology and software companies now have offices in India.\u000a\u000aThe history section of the articles Pakistan and Bangladesh discuss those countries since their creation.

VScientists have known since the late 19th century that the electron has a negative electric charge. The value of this charge was first measured by the American physicist Robert Millikan between 1909 and 1910. In Millikan\u2019s oil-drop experiment, he suspended tiny oil drops in a chamber containing an oil mist. By measuring the rate of fall of the oil drops, he was able to determine their weight. Oil drops that had an electric charge (acquired, for example, by friction when moving through the air) could then be slowed down or stopped by applying an electric force. By comparing applied electric force with changes in motion, Millikan was able to determine the electric charge on each drop. After he had measured many drops, he found that the charges on all of them were simple multiples of a single number. This basic unit of charge was the charge on the electron, and the different charges on the oil drops corresponded to those having 2, 3, 4,\u2026 extra electrons on them. The charge on the electron is now accepted to be 1.602176565 × 10\u221219 coulomb. For this work Millikan was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1923.\u000a\u000aThe charge on the proton is equal in magnitude to that on the electron but opposite in sign\u2014that is, the proton has a positive charge. Because opposite electric charges attract each other, there is an attractive force between electrons and protons. This force is what keeps electrons in orbit around the nucleus, something like the way that gravity keeps the Earth in orbit around the Sun.\u000a\u000aThe electron has a mass of about 9.109382911 × 10\u221228 gram. The mass of a proton or neutron is about 1,836 times larger. This explains why the mass of an atom is primarily determined by the mass of the protons and neutrons in the nucleus.\u000a\u000aThe electron has other intrinsic properties. One of these is called spin. The electron can be pictured as being something like Earth, spinning around an axis of rotation. In fact, most elementary particles have this property. Unlike Earth, however, they exist in the subatomic world and are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. Therefore, these particles cannot spin in any arbitrary way, but only at certain specific rates. These rates can be 1/ , 1, 3/ , 2,\u2026 times a basic unit of rotation. Like protons and neutrons, electrons have spin 1/ .\u000a\u000aParticles with half-integer spin are called fermions, for the Italian American physicist Enrico Fermi, who investigated their properties in the first half of the 20th century. Fermions have one important property that will help explain both the way that electrons are arranged in their orbits and the way that protons and neutrons are arranged inside the nucleus. They are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle (named for the Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli), which states that no two fermions can occupy the same state\u2014for example, the two electrons in a helium atom must have different spin directions if they occupy the same orbit.\u000a\u000aBecause a spinning electron can be thought of as a moving electric charge, electrons can be thought of as tiny electromagnets. This means that, like any other magnet, an electron will respond to the presence of a magnetic field by twisting. (Think of a compass needle pointing north under the influence of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field.) This fact is usually expressed by saying that electrons have a magnetic moment. In physics, magnetic moment relates the strength of a magnetic field to the torque experienced by a magnetic object. Because of their intrinsic spin, electrons have a magnetic moment given by \u22129.28 × 10\u221224 joule per tesla.

VIndia ( i//), officially the Republic of India (Bharat Ganrajya),[13][c] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country with over 1.2 billion people, and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the south-west, and the Bay of Bengal on the south-east, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[d] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north-east; and Burma and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; in addition, India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia.\u000a\u000aHome to the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation and a region of historic trade routes and vast empires, the Indian subcontinent was identified with its commercial and cultural wealth for much of its long history. Four world religions\u2014Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism\u2014originated here, whereas Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived in the 1st millennium CE and also helped shape the region's diverse culture. Gradually annexed by and brought under the administration of the British East India Company from the early 18th century and administered directly by the United Kingdom from the mid-19th century, India became an independent nation in 1947 after a struggle for independence that was marked by non-violent resistance led by Mahatma Gandhi.\u000a\u000aThe Indian economy is the world's tenth-largest by nominal GDP and third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).[15] Following market-based economic reforms in 1991, India became one of the fastest-growing major economies; it is considered a newly industrialised country. However, it continues to face the challenges of poverty, corruption, malnutrition, inadequate public healthcare, and terrorism. A nuclear weapons state and a regional power, it has the third-largest standing army in the world and ranks eighth in military expenditure among nations. India is a federal constitutional republic governed under a parliamentary system consisting of 29 states and 7 union territories. India is a pluralistic, multilingual, and a multi-ethnic society. It is also home to a diversity of wildlife in a variety of protected habitats.\u000a\u000aThe name India is derived from Indus, which originates from the Old Persian word Hindu\u0161. The latter term stems from the Sanskrit word Sindhu, which was the historical local appellation for the Indus River. The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (\u0399\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03af), which translates as "the people of the Indus". The geographical term Bharat ( [\u02c8b\u02b1a\u02d0r\u0259t\u032a] ), which is recognised by the Constitution of India as an official name for the country, is used by many Indian languages in its variations. The eponym of Bharat is Bharata, a theological figure that Hindu scriptures describe as a legendary emperor of ancient India. Hindustan ([\u0266\u026and\u032a\u028a\u02c8st\u032aa\u02d0n] ) was originally a Persian word that meant "Land of the Hindus"; prior to 1947, it referred to a region that encompassed northern India and Pakistan. It is occasionally used to solely denote India in its entirety.\u000a\u000aAnatomically modern humans are thought to have arrived in South Asia 73\u201355,000 years back, though the earliest authenticated human remains date to only about 30,000 years ago. Nearly contemporaneous Mesolithic rock art sites have been found in many parts of the Indian subcontinent, including at the Bhimbetka rock shelters in Madhya Pradesh. Around 7000 BCE, the first known Neolithic settlements appeared on the subcontinent in Mehrgarh and other sites in western Pakistan. These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation, the first urban culture in South Asia; It flourished during 2500\u20131900 BCE in Pakistan and western India. Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.\u000a\u000aDuring the period 2000\u2013500 BCE, in terms of culture, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic to the Iron Age. The Vedas, the oldest scriptures of Hinduism, were composed during this period, and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain. Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west. The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period, and small tribal units gradually coalesced into monarchical, state-level polities. On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation. In southern India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period, as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.\u000a\u000aIn the late Vedic period, around the 5th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas. The emerging urbanisation and the orthodoxies of this age also created heterodox religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira. In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal, and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire. The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent excepting the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas. The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.\u000a\u000aThe Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was being ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and South-East Asia. In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women. By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created in the greater Ganges Plain a complex system of administration and taxation that became a model for later Indian kingdoms. Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion rather than the management of ritual began to assert itself. The renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite. Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.\u000a\u000aThe Indian early medieval age, 600 CE to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity. When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan. When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal. When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south. No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond his core region. During this time, pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes. The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.\u000a\u000aIn the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language. They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent. Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised, drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well. Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation. By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Java. Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.\u000a\u000aAfter the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206. The sultanate was to control much of North India, and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs. By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north. The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire. Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India, and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.\u000a\u000aIn the early 16th century, northern India, being then under mainly Muslim rulers, fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors. The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule. Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status. The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency, caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets. The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion, resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture. Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience. Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India. As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.\u000a\u000aBy the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts. The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly flex its military muscle and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; both these factors were crucial in allowing the Company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies. Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s. India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British empire with raw materials, and many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period. By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and itself effectively made an arm of British administration, the Company began to more consciously enter non-economic arenas such as education, social reform, and culture.\u000a\u000aHistorians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes\u2014among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph\u2014were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe. However, disaffection with the Company also grew during this time, and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule. Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and to the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest. In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.\u000a\u000aThe rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks\u2014many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets. There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines, and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians. There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption. The railway network provided critical famine relief, notably reduced the cost of moving goods, and helped nascent Indian-owned industry. After World War I, in which some one million Indians served, a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a non-violent movement of non-cooperation, of which Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol. During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections. The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress's final push for non-cooperation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.\u000a\u000aVital to India's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic. In the 60 years since, India has had a mixed record of successes and failures. It has remained a democracy with civil liberties, an activist Supreme Court, and a largely independent press. Economic liberalisation, which was begun in the 1990s, has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world's fastest-growing economies, and increased its geopolitical clout. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture. Yet, India has also been weighed down by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural and urban; by religious and caste-related violence; by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies; and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India. It has unresolved territorial disputes with China, and with Pakistan. The India\u2013Pakistan nuclear rivalry came to a head in 1998. India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's new nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved.\u000a\u000aIndia comprises the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, and part of the Indo-Australian Plate. India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east. Simultaneously, the vast Tethyn oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian plate. These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas. Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Cut off from the plain by the ancient Aravalli Range lies the Thar Desert.\u000a\u000aThe original Indian plate survives as peninsular India, the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east. To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats; the plateau contains the country's oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6° 44' and 35° 30' north latitude[e] and 68° 7' and 97° 25' east longitude.\u000a\u000aIndia's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains. According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.\u000a\u000aMajor Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal. Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.\u000a\u000aThe Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.\u000a\u000aIndia lies within the Indomalaya ecozone and contains three biodiversity hotspots. One of 17 megadiverse countries, it hosts 8.6% of all mammalian, 13.7% of all avian, 7.9% of all reptilian, 6% of all amphibian, 12.2% of all piscine, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species. Endemism is high among plants, 33%, and among ecoregions such as the shola forests. Habitat ranges from the tropical rainforest of the Andaman Islands, Western Ghats, and North-East India to the coniferous forest of the Himalaya. Between these extremes lie the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India; the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India; and the babul-dominated thorn forest of the central Deccan and western Gangetic plain. Under 12% of India's landmass bears thick jungle. The medicinal neem, widely used in rural Indian herbal remedies, is a key Indian tree. The luxuriant pipal fig tree, shown on the seals of Mohenjo-daro, shaded Gautama Buddha as he sought enlightenment.\u000a\u000aMany Indian species descend from taxa originating in Gondwana, from which the Indian plate separated more than 105 million years before present. Peninsular India's subsequent movement towards and collision with the Laurasian landmass set off a mass exchange of species. Epochal volcanism and climatic changes 20 million years ago forced a mass extinction. Mammals then entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes flanking the rising Himalaya. Thus, while 45.8% of reptiles and 55.8% of amphibians are endemic, only 12.6% of mammals and 4.5% of birds are. Among them are the Nilgiri leaf monkey and Beddome's toad of the Western Ghats. India contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms. These include the Asiatic lion, the Bengal tiger, and the Indian White-rumped Vulture, which, by ingesting the carrion of diclofenac-laced cattle, nearly went extinct.\u000a\u000aThe pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response the system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was substantially expanded. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988. India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and thirteen biosphere reserves, four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; twenty-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.\u000a\u000aIndia is the world's most populous democracy. A parliamentary republic with a multi-party system, it has six recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 40 regional parties. The Congress is considered centre-left or "liberal" in Indian political culture, and the BJP centre-right or "conservative". For most of the period between 1950\u2014when India first became a republic\u2014and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP, as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalitions at the centre.\u000a\u000aIn the Republic of India's first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru's death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by Indira Gandhi, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in 1977; the then-new Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over three years. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition, led by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived: it lasted just under two years. Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. But the Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao.\u000a\u000aA two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two comparatively long-lasting United Front coalitions, which depended on external support. In 1998, the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term. In the 2004 Indian general elections, again no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from India's communist parties. That year, Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term. In the 2014 general election, Bharatiya Janata Party became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties.[155]\u000a\u000aIndia is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India, which serves as the country's supreme legal document. It is a constitutional republic and representative democracy, in which "majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law". Federalism in India defines the power distribution between the federal government and the states. The government abides by constitutional checks and balances. The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950, states in its preamble that India is a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic. India's form of government, traditionally described as "quasi-federal" with a strong centre and weak states, has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.\u000a\u000aIndia is a federation composed of 29 states and 7 union territories. All states, as well as the union territories of Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments, both patterned on the Westminster model. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the centre through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis. Since then, their structure has remained largely unchanged. Each state or union territory is further divided into administrative districts. The districts in turn are further divided into tehsils and ultimately into villages.\u000a\u000aSince its independence in 1947, India has maintained cordial relations with most nations. In the 1950s, it strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and played a lead role in the Non-Aligned Movement. In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of neighbouring countries: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a coup d'état attempt in Maldives. India has tense relations with neighbouring Pakistan; the two nations have gone to war four times: in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999. Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, while the fourth, the 1971 war, followed from India's support for the independence of Bangladesh. After waging the 1962 Sino-Indian War and the 1965 war with Pakistan, India pursued close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.\u000a\u000aAside from ongoing strategic relations with Russia, India has wide-ranging defence relations with Israel and France. In recent years, it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organisation. The nation has provided 100,000 military and police personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four continents. It participates in the East Asia Summit, the G8+5, and other multilateral forums. India has close economic ties with South America,[182] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a "Look East" policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN nations, Japan, and South Korea that revolve around many issues, but especially those involving economic investment and regional security.\u000a\u000aChina's nuclear test of 1964, as well as its repeated threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war, convinced India to develop nuclear weapons. India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and carried out further underground testing in 1998. Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory. India maintains a "no first use" nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its "minimum credible deterrence" doctrine. It is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and, in collaboration with Russia, a fifth-generation fighter jet. Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of Vikrant-class aircraft carriers and Arihant-class nuclear submarines.\u000a\u000aSince the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military cooperation with the United States and the European Union. In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state. India subsequently signed cooperation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada.\u000a\u000aThe President of India is the supreme commander of the nation's armed forces; with 1,325 million active troops, they compose the world's third-largest military. It comprises the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, and the Indian Air Force; auxiliary organisations include the Strategic Forces Command and three paramilitary groups: the Assam Rifles, the Special Frontier Force, and the Indian Coast Guard. The official Indian defence budget for 2011 was US$36.03 billion, or 1.83% of GDP. For the fiscal year spanning 2012\u20132013, US$40.44 billion was budgeted. According to a 2008 SIPRI report, India's annual military expenditure in terms of purchasing power stood at US$72.7 billion, In 2011, the annual defence budget increased by 11.6%, although this does not include funds that reach the military through other branches of government. As of 2012, India is the world's largest arms importer; between 2007 and 2011, it accounted for 10% of funds spent on international arms purchases. Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean.\u000a\u000aAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as of 2013, the Indian economy is nominally worth US$1.842 trillion; it is the eleventh-largest economy by market exchange rates, and is, at US$4.962 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity, or PPP.[9] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011\u201312, India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies. However, the country ranks 140th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 129th in GDP per capita at PPP. Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy; since then it has slowly moved towards a free-market system by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows. India's recent economic model is largely capitalist. India has been a member of WTO since 1 January 1995.\u000a\u000aThe 486.6-million worker Indian labour force is the world's second-largest, as of 2011. The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. Major agricultural products include rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes. Major industries include textiles, telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food processing, steel, transport equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, and software. In 2006, the share of external trade in India's GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985. In 2008, India's share of world trade was 1.68%; In 2011, India was the world's tenth-largest importer and the nineteenth-largest exporter. Major exports include petroleum products, textile goods, jewellery, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and leather manufactures. Major imports include crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser, and chemicals. Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%.\u000a\u000aAveraging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior to 2007, India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decade of the 21st century. Some 431 million Indians have left poverty since 1985; India's middle classes are projected to number around 580 million by 2030. Though ranking 51st in global competitiveness, India ranks 17th in financial market sophistication, 24th in the banking sector, 44th in business sophistication, and 39th in innovation, ahead of several advanced economies, as of 2010. With 7 of the world's top 15 information technology outsourcing companies based in India, the country is viewed as the second-most favourable outsourcing destination after the United States, as of 2009. India's consumer market, currently the world's eleventh-largest, is expected to become fifth-largest by 2030.\u000a\u000aIndia's telecommunication industry, the world's fastest-growing, added 227 million subscribers during the period 2010\u201311, and after the first quarter of 2013, India surpassed Japan to become the third largest smartphone market in the world after China and the U.S.[220]\u000a\u000aIts automotive industry, the world's second fastest growing, increased domestic sales by 26% during 2009\u201310, and exports by 36% during 2008\u201309. Power capacity is 250 gigawatts, of which 8% is renewable. At the end of 2011, Indian IT Industry employed 2.8 million professionals, generated revenues close to US$100 billion equalling 7.5% of Indian GDP and contributed 26% of India's merchandise exports.\u000a\u000aThe Pharmaceutical industry in India is among the significant emerging markets for global pharma industry. The Indian pharmaceutical market is expected to reach $48.5 billion by 2020. India's R & D spending constitutes 60% of Biopharmaceutical industry.[224][225] India is among the top 12 Biotech destinations of the world.[226] The Indian biotech industry grew by 15.1% in 2012-13, increasing its revenues from 204.4 Billion INR (Indian Rupees) to 235.24 Billion INR (3.94 B US$ - exchange rate June 2013: 1 US$ approx. 60 INR)[228] Although hardly 2% of Indians pay income taxes.[229]\u000a\u000aDespite impressive economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. India contains the largest concentration of people living below the World Bank's international poverty line of US$1.25 per day, the proportion having decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005, and 25% in 2011 44% of India's children under the age of five are underweight, half the children under five suffer from chronic malnutrition, and in the states of Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Jharkand, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, which account for 50.04% of India's population, 70% of the children between the ages of six months and 59 months are anaemic.[232] The Mid-Day Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates. Since 1991, economic inequality between India's states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest. Corruption in India is perceived to have increased significantly, with one report estimating the illegal capital flows since independence to be US$462 billion.\u000a\u000aDriven by growth, India's nominal GDP per capita has steadily increased from US$329 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to US$1,265 in 2010, and is estimated to increase to US$2,110 by 2016; however, it has remained lower than those of other Asian developing countries such as Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and is expected to remain so in the near future. While it is currently higher than Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and others.\u000a\u000aAccording to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers report, India's GDP at purchasing power parity could overtake that of the United States by 2045. During the next four decades, Indian GDP is expected to grow at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy until 2050. The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle class. The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.\u000a\u000aCiting persistent inflation pressures, weak public finances, limited progress on fiscal consolidation and ineffectiveness of the government, rating agency Fitch revised India's Outlook to Negative from Stable on 18 June 2012.[240] Another credit rating agency S&P had warned previously that a slowing GDP growth and political roadblocks to economic policy-making could put India at the risk of losing its investment grade rating.[241] However, Moody did not revise its outlook on India keeping it stable,[242] but termed the national government as the "single biggest drag" on business activity.[243]\u000a\u000aWith 1,210,193,422 residents reported in the 2011 provisional census, India is the world's second-most populous country. Its population grew at 1.76% per annum during 2001\u20132011, down from 2.13% per annum in the previous decade (1991\u20132001). The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males. The median age was 24.9 in the 2001 census. The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361.1 million people.[245] Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the "Green Revolution" have caused India's population to grow rapidly. India continues to face several public health-related challenges. Life expectancy in India is at 68 years with life expectancy for women being 69.6 years and for men being 67.3.[249] There are around 50 physicians per 100,000 Indians. The number of Indians living in urban areas has grown by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001. Yet, in 2001, over 70% lived in rural areas. According to the 2001 census, there are 27 million-plus cities in India; among them Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Pune are the most populous metropolitan areas. The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males. Kerala is the most literate state with 95.5% literacy; while Bihar the least with 67.8%.\u000a\u000aIndia is home to two major language families: Indo-Aryan (spoken by about 74% of the population) and Dravidian (24%). Other languages spoken in India come from the Austroasiatic and Tibeto-Burman language families. India has no national language. Hindi, with the largest number of speakers, is the official language of the government. English is used extensively in business and administration and has the status of a "subsidiary official language"; it is important in education, especially as a medium of higher education. Each state and union territory has one or more official languages, and the constitution recognises in particular 21 "scheduled languages". The Constitution of India recognises 212 scheduled tribal groups which together constitute about 7.5% of the country's population. The 2001 census reported that Hinduism, with over 800 million adherents (80.5% of the population), was the largest religion in India; it is followed by Islam (13.4%), Christianity (2.3%), Sikhism (1.9%), Buddhism (0.8%), Jainism (0.4%), Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and the Bahá'í Faith. India has the world's largest Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Zoroastrian, and Bahá'í populations, and has the third-largest Muslim population and the largest Muslim population for a non-Muslim majority country.[262][263]\u000a\u000aIndian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years. During the Vedic period (c. 1700 \u2013 500 BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dhárma, kárma, yóga, and mok\u1e63a, were established. India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions. The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads, the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti movement, and by Buddhist philosophy.\u000a\u000aMuch of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Mughal architecture, and South Indian architecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported styles. Vernacular architecture is also highly regional in it flavours. Vastu shastra, literally "science of construction" or "architecture" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan, explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings; it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs. As applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by the Shilpa Shastras, a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the Vastu-Purusha mandala, a square that embodied the "absolute". The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage." Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture.\u000a\u000aThe earliest literary writings in India, composed between 1400 BCE and 1200 CE, were in the Sanskrit language. Prominent works of this Sanskrit literature include epics such as the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and the Ramayana, the dramas of K\u0101lid\u0101sa such as the Abhijñ\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntalam (The Recognition of \u015aakuntal\u0101), and poetry such as the Mah\u0101k\u0101vya. Kamasutra, the famous book about sexual intercourse also originated in India. Developed between 600 BCE and 300 CE in South India, the Sangam literature, consisting of 2,381 poems, is regarded as a predecessor of Tamil literature. From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets such as Kab\u012br, Tuls\u012bd\u0101s, and Guru N\u0101nak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions. In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of Bengali poet and novelist Rabindranath Tagore.\u000a\u000aIndian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern Hindustani and southern Carnatic schools. Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well-known form of the latter. Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-known folk dances are the bhangra of the Punjab, the bihu of Assam, the chhau of Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand,Garba and Dandiya of Gujarat, sambalpuri of Odisha, ghoomar of Rajasthan, and the lavani of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India's National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama. These are: bharatanatyam of the state of Tamil Nadu, kathak of Uttar Pradesh, kathakali and mohiniyattam of Kerala, kuchipudi of Andhra Pradesh, manipuri of Manipur, odissi of Odisha, and the sattriya of Assam. Theatre in India melds music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue. Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes the bhavai of Gujarat, the jatra of West Bengal, the nautanki and ramlila of North India, tamasha of Maharashtra, burrakatha of Andhra Pradesh, terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu, and the yakshagana of Karnataka.\u000a\u000aThe Indian film industry produces the world's most-watched cinema. Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the Assamese, Bengali, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Oriya, Tamil, and Telugu languages. South Indian cinema attracts more than 75% of national film revenue. Television broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of communication, and had slow expansion for more than two decades. The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s and, since then, satellite channels have increasingly shaped popular culture of Indian society. Today, television is the most penetrative media in India; industry estimates indicate that as of 2012 there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462 million with satellite and/or cable connections, compared to other forms of mass media such as press (350 million), radio (156 million) or internet (37 million).\u000a\u000aTraditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found in the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as j\u0101tis, or "castes". India declared untouchability to be illegal[297] in 1947 and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives. At the workplace in urban India and in international or leading Indian companies, the caste related identification has pretty much lost its importance. Family values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational patriarchal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas. An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family members. Marriage is thought to be for life, and the divorce rate is extremely low. Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women in India wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age. Female infanticide in India and female foeticide in India have caused a discrepancy in the sex ratio, as of 2005 it was estimated that there were 50 million more males than females in the nation. However the recent report from 2011 shown improvement among the gender ratio.[306] The payment of Dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines.[307] Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, is on the rise.[308]\u000a\u000aMany Indian festivals are religious in origin; among them are Chhath, Christmas, Diwali, Durga Puja, Bakr-Id, Eid ul-Fitr, Ganesh Chaturthi, Holi, Makar Sankranti or Uttarayan, Navratri, Thai Pongal, and Vaisakhi. India has three national holidays which are observed in all states and union territories: Republic Day, Independence Day, and Gandhi Jayanti. Other sets of holidays, varying between nine and twelve, are officially observed in individual states.\u000a\u000aThroughout India, many people practice customs and religious rituals, such as "Sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra," which is a series of "personal sacraments and rites conducted at various stages throughout life."[309]\u000a\u000aCotton was domesticated in India by 4000 B.C.E. Traditional Indian dress varies in colour and style across regions and depends on various factors, including climate and faith. Popular styles of dress include draped garments such as the sari for women and the dhoti or lungi for men. Stitched clothes, such as the shalwar kameez for women and kurta\u2013pyjama combinations or European-style trousers and shirts for men, are also popular. Use of delicate jewellery, modelled on real flowers worn in ancient India, is part of a tradition dating back some 5,000 years; gemstones are also worn in India as talismans.\u000a\u000aIn India, several traditional indigenous sports remain fairly popular, such as kabaddi, kho kho, pehlwani and gilli-danda. Some of the earliest forms of Asian martial arts, such as kalarippayattu, musti yuddha, silambam, and marma adi, originated in India. Chess, commonly held to have originated in India as chatura\u1e45ga, is regaining widespread popularity with the rise in the number of Indian grandmasters. Pachisi, from which parcheesi derives, was played on a giant marble court by Akbar.\u000a\u000aThe improved results garnered by the Indian Davis Cup team and other Indian tennis players in the early 2010s have made tennis increasingly popular in the country. India has a comparatively strong presence in shooting sports, and has won several medals at the Olympics, the World Shooting Championships, and the Commonwealth Games. Other sports in which Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton, boxing, and wrestling. Football is popular in West Bengal, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the north-eastern states.\u000a\u000aField hockey in India is administered by Hockey India. The Indian national hockey team won the 1975 Hockey World Cup and have, as of 2012, taken eight gold, one silver, and two bronze Olympic medals, making it the sport's most successful team in the Olympics.\u000a\u000aIndia has also played a major role in popularising cricket. Thus, cricket is, by far, the most popular sport of India. The Indian national cricket team won the 1983 and 2011 Cricket World Cup events, the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, shared the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka, and won 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. Cricket in India is administered by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI); the Ranji Trophy, the Duleep Trophy, the Deodhar Trophy, the Irani Trophy, and the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy are domestic competitions. The BCCI is also responsible for conducting an annual Twenty20 competition known as the Indian Premier League.\u000a\u000aIndia has hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events: the 1951 and 1982 Asian Games; the 1987, 1996, and 2011 Cricket World Cup tournaments; the 2003 Afro-Asian Games; the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy; the 2010 Hockey World Cup; and the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Major international sporting events held annually in India include the Chennai Open, the Mumbai Marathon, the Delhi Half Marathon, and the Indian Masters. The first Indian Grand Prix featured in late 2011.\u000a\u000aIndia has traditionally been the dominant country at the South Asian Games. An example of this dominance is the basketball competition where Team India won three out of four tournaments to date.[323] The Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna and the Arjuna Award are the highest forms of government recognition for athletic achievement; the Dronacharya Award is awarded for excellence in coaching.

Except for the hydrogen atom itself (which is neutral) these atoms carry positive charge e(Z-1), where Z is the atomic number of the atom and e is the elementary charge. A better\u2014but never used\u2014name would therefore be hydrogen-like cations.\u000a\u000aBecause hydrogen-like atoms are two-particle systems with an interaction depending only on the distance between the two particles, their non-relativistic Schrödinger equation can be solved in analytic form. The solutions are one-electron functions and are referred to as hydrogen-like atomic orbitals. The orbitals of the different hydrogen-like atoms differ from one another in one respect only: they depend on the nuclear charge eZ (which appears in their radial part).\u000a\u000aHydrogen-like atoms per se do not play an important role in chemistry or physics. The interest in these atoms is mainly because their Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, in exactly the same way as the Schrödinger equation of the hydrogen atom.\u000a\u000aThe non-relativistic wave functions (orbitals) of hydrogen-like atoms are known analytically and are labeled by three exact quantum numbers, conventionally designated n, \u2113, and m. These quantum numbers play an important role in atomic physics and chemistry, as they are useful labels for quantum mechanical states of more-electron atoms, too. Although the three quantum numbers are not exact for an atom with more than one electron, they are still approximately valid, see this article. Because the (for many-electron atoms) approximate quantum numbers n, \u2113, and m are the building bricks of the Aufbau principle (building-up principle)\u2014the construction of the electronic configuration of atoms\u2014they are discussed at some length in this section.\u000a\u000aHydrogen-like atomic orbitals are eigenfunctions of a Hamiltonian H (energy operator) with eigenvalues proportional to 1/n², where n is a positive integer, referred to as principal quantum number. Observe the somewhat unexpected fact that these eigenvalues do depend solely on n.\u000a\u000aThe hydrogen orbitals are usually chosen such that they are simultaneously eigenfunctions of H and l2, the square of the one-electron angular momentum vector operator\u000a\u000awhere \u210f is Planck's constant divided by 2\u03c0, the symbol × stands for a cross product, \u2207 is the gradient operator, and r is the vector pointing from the nucleus to the electron.\u000a\u000aFrom quantum mechanics it is known that a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of simultaneous eigenfunctions of H and l 2 is the commutation of the operators\u000a\u000aThese two operators indeed commute. (This is due to the spherical symmetry of H.) The squared operator l 2 has eigenvalues proportional to \u2113(\u2113+1), where \u2113 is a non-negative integer (the azimuthal quantum number, also known as the angular momentum quantum number).\u000a\u000aFurther, since l 2 commutes with the three angular momentum components l , l , and l , it is possible to require an orbital to be an eigenfunction of any of the three components. It is conventional to choose l , which has an eigenvalue proportional to an integer usually denoted by m (the so-called magnetic quantum number).\u000a\u000aIn other words, the degeneracy (maximum number of linearly independent eigenfunctions of same energy) of energy level n is equal to n2. This is the dimension of the irreducible representations of the symmetry group of hydrogen-like atoms, which is SO(4), and not SO(3) as for many-electron atoms.\u000a\u000aA hydrogen-like atomic orbital \u03c8   is uniquely identified by the values of the principal quantum number n, the azimuthal quantum number \u2113, and the magnetic quantum number m. These three quantum numbers are natural numbers, their definitions and ranges are:\u000a\u000aHere E is the atomic unit of energy, see below. Note that n \u2265 \u2113+1.\u000a\u000aIt is very common to denote the orbitals of different angular momentum by different letters, 2s-, 3p-orbital, etc. For historical reasons \u2113 = 0 orbitals are designated by s (sharp), \u2113 = 1 by p (principal), \u2113 = 2 by d (diffuse), and \u2113 = 3 by f (fundamental) . For higher \u2113 orbitals the alphabet is followed, while j orbitals are omitted. Thus we get the following association between letters and \u2113 quantum numbers\u000a\u000aFor instance, hydrogenic g-orbitals (\u2113=4) start at principal quantum number n = 5, so that we can speak of 5g-, 6g-, etc. orbitals, but a hydrogen-like 4g-orbital is not defined (i.e., does not appear as a solution of the hydrogen-like Schrödinger equation).\u000a\u000aThe set of orbital quantum numbers must be augmented by the two-valued spin quantum number m s = ±½ in application of the exclusion principle. This principle restricts the allowed values of the four quantum numbers in electron configurations of more-electron atoms: it is forbidden that two electrons have the same four quantum numbers. This is an important restriction in constructing atomic states by application of the Aufbau (building up) principle.\u000a\u000aThe atomic orbitals of hydrogen-like atoms are solutions of the time-independent Schrödinger equation in a potential given by Coulomb's law:\u000a\u000aThe Schrödinger equation is the following eigenvalue equation of the Hamiltonian (the quantity in large square brackets):\u000a\u000awhere \u03bc is the reduced mass of the system consisting of the electron and the nucleus. Because the electron mass is about 1836 times smaller than the mass of the lightest nucleus (the proton), the value of \u03bc is very close to the mass of the electron m for all hydrogenic atoms. In the derivation below we will make the approximation \u03bc = m . Since m will appear explicitly in the formulas it will be easy to correct for this approximation if necessary.\u000a\u000aIn this article (in which l 2 is defined without Planck's constant and imaginary unit i) it is shown that the operator \u2207² expressed in spherical polar coordinates, can be written as\u000a\u000aThe wave function is written as a product of functions in the spirit of the method of separation of variables:\u000a\u000awhere Y are spherical harmonics, which are eigenfunctions of l 2 with eigenvalues . Substituting this product, letting l 2 act on Y , and dividing out Y , we arrive at the following one-dimensional Schrödinger equation:\u000a\u000aIn addition to l and m, there arises a third integer n > 0 from the boundary conditions imposed on R(r). The expression for the normalized wave function is:\u000a\u000awhere Y (\u03b8,\u03c6) is a spherical harmonic. Below it will be derived that the radial function (normalized to unity) is,\u000a\u000aNote that a is approximately equal to a (the Bohr radius). If the mass of the nucleus is infinite then \u03bc = m and a = a .\u000a\u000aThe energy eigenvalue associated with \u03c8 is:\u000a\u000aAs we pointed out above it depends only on n, not on l or m.\u000a\u000aAs is shown above, we must solve the one-dimensional eigenvalue equation,\u000a\u000awhere we approximated \u03bc by m . If the substitution u(r) = rR(r) is made, the radial equation becomes\u000a\u000awhich is a Schrödinger equation for the function u(r) with an effective potential given by\u000a\u000aThe correction to the potential V(r) is called the centrifugal barrier term.\u000a\u000aIn order to simplify the Schrödinger equation, we introduce the following constants that define the atomic unit of energy and length, respectively,\u000a\u000aSubstitute   and     into the radial Schrödinger equation given above. This gives an equation in which all natural constants are hidden,\u000a\u000aTwo classes of solutions of this equation exist: \u000a\u000a (i) W is negative, the corresponding eigenfunctions are square integrable and the values of W are quantized (discrete spectrum).\u000a\u000a (ii) W is non-negative. Every real non-negative value of W is physically allowed (continuous spectrum), the corresponding eigenfunctions are non-square integrable. \u000a\u000a In the remaining part of this article only class (i) solutions will be considered. The wavefunctions are known as bound states, in contrast to the class (ii) solutions that are known as scattering states.\u000a\u000aFor negative W the quantity is real and positive.

We will take the convention for generalized Laguerre polynomials of Abramowitz and Stegun.[1] Note that the Laguerre polynomials given in many quantum mechanical textbooks, for instance the book of Messiah,[2] are those of Abramowitz and Stegun multiplied by a factor (2l+1+k)!

VA prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors, whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory: any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering. The uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization, e.g., 3, 1 × 3, 1 × 1 × 3, etc. are all valid factorizations of 3.\u000a\u000aThe property of being prime (or not) is called primality. A simple but slow method of verifying the primality of a given number n is known as trial division. It consists of testing whether n is a multiple of any integer between 2 and . Algorithms much more efficient than trial division have been devised to test the primality of large numbers. Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as Mersenne numbers. As of April 2014 , the largest known prime number has 17,425,170 decimal digits.\u000a\u000aThere are infinitely many primes, as demonstrated by Euclid around 300 BC. There is no known useful formula that sets apart all of the prime numbers from composites. However, the distribution of primes, that is to say, the statistical behaviour of primes in the large, can be modelled. The first result in that direction is the prime number theorem, proven at the end of the 19th century, which says that the probability that a given, randomly chosen number n is prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits, or to the logarithm of n.\u000a\u000aMany questions around prime numbers remain open, such as Goldbach's conjecture (that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes), and the twin prime conjecture (that there are infinitely many pairs of primes whose difference is 2). Such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory, focusing on analytic or algebraic aspects of numbers. Primes are used in several routines in information technology, such as public-key cryptography, which makes use of properties such as the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors. Prime numbers give rise to various generalizations in other mathematical domains, mainly algebra, such as prime elements and prime ideals.\u000a\u000aA natural number (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.) is called a prime or a prime number if it has exactly two positive divisors, 1 and the number itself.[1] Natural numbers greater than 1 that are not prime are called composite.\u000a\u000aAmong the numbers 1 to 6, the numbers 2, 3, and 5 are the prime numbers, while 1, 4, and 6 are not prime. 1 is excluded as a prime number, for reasons explained below. 2 is a prime number, since the only natural numbers dividing it are 1 and 2. Next, 3 is prime, too: 1 and 3 do divide 3 without remainder, but 3 divided by 2 gives remainder 1. Thus, 3 is prime. However, 4 is composite, since 2 is another number (in addition to 1 and 4) dividing 4 without remainder:\u000a\u000a5 is again prime: none of the numbers 2, 3, or 4 divide 5. Next, 6 is divisible by 2 or 3, since\u000a\u000aHence, 6 is not prime. The image at the right illustrates that 12 is not prime: 12 = 3 · 4. No even number greater than 2 is prime because by definition, any such number n has at least three distinct divisors, namely 1, 2, and n. This implies that n is not prime. Accordingly, the term odd prime refers to any prime number greater than 2. In a similar vein, all prime numbers bigger than 5, written in the usual decimal system, end in 1, 3, 7, or 9, since even numbers are multiples of 2 and numbers ending in 0 or 5 are multiples of 5.\u000a\u000aIf n is a natural number, then 1 and n divide n without remainder. Therefore, the condition of being a prime can also be restated as: a number is prime if it is greater than one and if none of\u000a\u000adivides n (without remainder). Yet another way to say the same is: a number n > 1 is prime if it cannot be written as a product of two integers a and b, both of which are larger than 1:\u000a\u000aIn other words, n is prime if n items cannot be divided up into smaller equal-size groups of more than one item.\u000a\u000aThe set of all primes is often denoted by P.\u000a\u000aThe first 168 prime numbers (all the prime numbers less than 1000) are:\u000a\u000aThe crucial importance of prime numbers to number theory and mathematics in general stems from the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every integer larger than 1 can be written as a product of one or more primes in a way that is unique except for the order of the prime factors.[2] Primes can thus be considered the \u201cbasic building blocks\u201d of the natural numbers. For example:\u000a\u000aAs in this example, the same prime factor may occur multiple times. A decomposition:\u000a\u000aof a number n into (finitely many) prime factors p , p , ... to p is called prime factorization of n. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic can be rephrased so as to say that any factorization into primes will be identical except for the order of the factors. So, albeit there are many prime factorization algorithms to do this in practice for larger numbers, they all have to yield the same result.\u000a\u000aIf p is a prime number and p divides a product ab of integers, then p divides a or p divides b. This proposition is known as Euclid's lemma.[3] It is used in some proofs of the uniqueness of prime factorizations.\u000a\u000aMost early Greeks did not even consider 1 to be a number,[4] and so they did not consider it a prime. In the 19th century however, many mathematicians did consider the number 1 a prime. For example, Derrick Norman Lehmer's list of primes up to 10,006,721, reprinted as late as 1956,[5] started with 1 as its first prime.[6] Henri Lebesgue is said to be the last professional mathematician to call 1 prime.[7] Although a large body of mathematical work would still be valid when calling 1 a prime, the above fundamental theorem of arithmetic would not hold as stated. For example, the number 15 can be factored as 3 · 5 or 1 · 3 · 5. If 1 were admitted as a prime, these two presentations would be considered different factorizations of 15 into prime numbers, so the statement of that theorem would have to be modified. Furthermore, the prime numbers have several properties that the number 1 lacks, such as the relationship of the number to its corresponding value of Euler's totient function or the sum of divisors function.[8][9]\u000a\u000aThere are hints in the surviving records of the ancient Egyptians that they had some knowledge of prime numbers: the Egyptian fraction expansions in the Rhind papyrus, for instance, have quite different forms for primes and for composites. However, the earliest surviving records of the explicit study of prime numbers come from the Ancient Greeks. Euclid's Elements (circa 300 BC) contain important theorems about primes, including the infinitude of primes and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Euclid also showed how to construct a perfect number from a Mersenne prime. The Sieve of Eratosthenes, attributed to Eratosthenes, is a simple method to compute primes, although the large primes found today with computers are not generated this way.\u000a\u000aAfter the Greeks, little happened with the study of prime numbers until the 17th century. In 1640 Pierre de Fermat stated (without proof) Fermat's little theorem (later proved by Leibniz and Euler). Fermat also conjectured that all numbers of the form 22n + 1 are prime (they are called Fermat numbers) and he verified this up to n = 4 (or 216 + 1). However, the very next Fermat number 232 + 1 is composite (one of its prime factors is 641), as Euler discovered later, and in fact no further Fermat numbers are known to be prime. The French monk Marin Mersenne looked at primes of the form 2p \u2212 1, with p a prime. They are called Mersenne primes in his honor.\u000a\u000aEuler's work in number theory included many results about primes. He showed the infinite series 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7 + 1/11 + \u2026 is divergent. In 1747 he showed that the even perfect numbers are precisely the integers of the form 2p\u22121(2p \u2212 1), where the second factor is a Mersenne prime.\u000a\u000aAt the start of the 19th century, Legendre and Gauss independently conjectured that as x tends to infinity, the number of primes up to x is asymptotic to x/ln(x), where ln(x) is the natural logarithm of x. Ideas of Riemann in his 1859 paper on the zeta-function sketched a program that would lead to a proof of the prime number theorem. This outline was completed by Hadamard and de la Vallée Poussin, who independently proved the prime number theorem in 1896.\u000a\u000aProving a number is prime is not done (for large numbers) by trial division. Many mathematicians have worked on primality tests for large numbers, often restricted to specific number forms. This includes Pépin's test for Fermat numbers (1877), Proth's theorem (around 1878), the Lucas\u2013Lehmer primality test (originated 1856),[10] and the generalized Lucas primality test. More recent algorithms like APRT-CL, ECPP, and AKS work on arbitrary numbers but remain much slower.\u000a\u000aFor a long time, prime numbers were thought to have extremely limited application outside of pure mathematics.[11] This changed in the 1970s when the concepts of public-key cryptography were invented, in which prime numbers formed the basis of the first algorithms such as the RSA cryptosystem algorithm.\u000a\u000aSince 1951 all the largest known primes have been found by computers. The search for ever larger primes has generated interest outside mathematical circles. The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search and other distributed computing projects to find large primes have become popular in the last ten to fifteen years,[clarification needed] while mathematicians continue to struggle with the theory of primes.\u000a\u000aThere are infinitely many prime numbers. Another way of saying this is that the sequence\u000a\u000aof prime numbers never ends. This statement is referred to as Euclid's theorem in honor of the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, since the first known proof for this statement is attributed to him. Many more proofs of the infinitude of primes are known, including an analytical proof by Euler, Goldbach's proof based on Fermat numbers,[12] Furstenberg's proof using general topology,[13] and Kummer's elegant proof.[14]\u000a\u000aEuclid's proof (Book IX, Proposition 20[15]) considers any finite set S of primes. The key idea is to consider the product of all these numbers plus one:\u000a\u000aLike any other natural number, N is divisible by at least one prime number (it is possible that N itself is prime).\u000a\u000aNone of the primes by which N is divisible can be members of the finite set S of primes with which we started, because dividing N by any one of these leaves a remainder of 1. Therefore the primes by which N is divisible are additional primes beyond the ones we started with. Thus any finite set of primes can be extended to a larger finite set of primes.\u000a\u000aIt is often erroneously reported that Euclid begins with the assumption that the set initially considered contains all prime numbers, leading to a contradiction, or that it contains precisely the n smallest primes rather than any arbitrary finite set of primes.[16] Today, the product of the smallest n primes plus 1 is conventionally called the nth Euclid number.\u000a\u000aEuler's proof uses the sum of the reciprocals of primes,\u000a\u000aThis sum becomes larger than any arbitrary real number provided that p is big enough.[17] This shows that there are infinitely many primes, since otherwise this sum would grow only until the biggest prime p is reached. The growth of S(p) is quantified by Mertens' second theorem.[18] For comparison, the sum\u000a\u000adoes not grow to infinity as n goes to infinity. In this sense, prime numbers occur more often than squares of natural numbers. Brun's theorem states that the sum of the reciprocals of twin primes,\u000a\u000aThere are various methods to determine whether a given number n is prime. The most basic routine, trial division, is of little practical use because of its slowness. One group of modern primality tests is applicable to arbitrary numbers, while more efficient tests are available for particular numbers. Most such methods only tell whether n is prime or not. Routines also yielding one (or all) prime factors of n are called factorization algorithms.\u000a\u000aThe most basic method of checking the primality of a given integer n is called trial division. This routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of n. If the result of any of these divisions is an integer, then n is not a prime, otherwise it is a prime. Indeed, if is composite (with a and b \u2260 1) then one of the factors a or b is necessarily at most . For example, for , the trial divisions are by m = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. None of these numbers divides 37, so 37 is prime. This routine can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to is known\u2014then trial divisions need to be checked only for those m that are prime. For example, to check the primality of 37, only three divisions are necessary (m = 2, 3, and 5), given that 4 and 6 are composite.\u000a\u000aWhile a simple method, trial division quickly becomes impractical for testing large integers because the number of possible factors grows too rapidly as n increases. According to the prime number theorem explained below, the number of prime numbers less than is approximately given by , so the algorithm may need up to this number of trial divisions to check the primality of n. For n = 1020, this number is 450 million\u2014too large for many practical applications.\u000a\u000aAn algorithm yielding all primes up to a given limit, such as required in the trial division method, is called a prime number sieve. The oldest example, the sieve of Eratosthenes (see above) is useful for relatively small primes. The modern sieve of Atkin is more complicated, but faster when properly optimized. Before the advent of computers, lists of primes up to bounds like 107 were also used.[19]\u000a\u000aModern primality tests for general numbers n can be divided into two main classes, probabilistic (or "Monte Carlo") and deterministic algorithms. Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not. For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if it performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime. On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then we know that the number is composite.\u000a\u000aA particularly simple example of a probabilistic test is the Fermat primality test, which relies on the fact (Fermat's little theorem) that np\u2261n (mod p) for any n if p is a prime number. If we have a number b that we want to test for primality, then we work out nb (mod b) for a random value of n as our test. A flaw with this test is that there are some composite numbers (the Carmichael numbers) that satisfy the Fermat identity even though they are not prime, so the test has no way of distinguishing between prime numbers and Carmichael numbers. Carmichael numbers are substantially rarer than prime numbers, though, so this test can be useful for practical purposes. More powerful extensions of the Fermat primality test, such as the Baillie-PSW, Miller-Rabin, and Solovay-Strassen tests, are guaranteed to fail at least some of the time when applied to a composite number.\u000a\u000aDeterministic algorithms do not erroneously report composite numbers as prime. In practice, the fastest such method is known as elliptic curve primality proving. Analyzing its run time is based on heuristic arguments, as opposed to the rigorously proven complexity of the more recent AKS primality test. Deterministic methods are typically slower than probabilistic ones, so the latter ones are typically applied first before a more time-consuming deterministic routine is employed.\u000a\u000aThe following table lists a number of prime tests. The running time is given in terms of n, the number to be tested and, for probabilistic algorithms, the number k of tests performed. Moreover, \u03b5 is an arbitrarily small positive number, and log is the logarithm to an unspecified base. The big O notation means that, for example, elliptic curve primality proving requires a time that is bounded by a factor (not depending on n, but on \u03b5) times log5+\u03b5(n).\u000a\u000aIn addition to the aforementioned tests applying to any natural number n, a number of much more efficient primality tests is available for special numbers. For example, to run Lucas' primality test requires the knowledge of the prime factors of n \u2212 1, while the Lucas\u2013Lehmer primality test needs the prime factors of n + 1 as input. For example, these tests can be applied to check whether\u000a\u000aare prime. Prime numbers of this form are known as factorial primes. Other primes where either p + 1 or p \u2212 1 is of a particular shape include the Sophie Germain primes (primes of the form 2p + 1 with p prime), primorial primes, Fermat primes and Mersenne primes, that is, prime numbers that are of the form 2p \u2212 1, where p is an arbitrary prime. The Lucas\u2013Lehmer test is particularly fast for numbers of this form. This is why the largest known prime has almost always been a Mersenne prime since the dawn of electronic computers.\u000a\u000aFermat primes are of the form\u000a\u000awith k an arbitrary natural number. They are named after Pierre de Fermat who conjectured that all such numbers F are prime. This was based on the evidence of the first five numbers in this series\u20143, 5, 17, 257, and 65,537\u2014being prime. However, F is composite and so are all other Fermat numbers that have been verified as of 2011. A regular n-gon is constructible using straightedge and compass if and only if\u000a\u000awhere m is a product of any number of distinct Fermat primes and i is any natural number, including zero.\u000a\u000aThe following table gives the largest known primes of the mentioned types. Some of these primes have been found using distributed computing. In 2009, the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search project was awarded a US$100,000 prize for first discovering a prime with at least 10 million digits.[20] The Electronic Frontier Foundation also offers $150,000 and $250,000 for primes with at least 100 million digits and 1 billion digits, respectively.[21] Some of the largest primes not known to have any particular form (that is, no simple formula such as that of Mersenne primes) have been found by taking a piece of semi-random binary data, converting it to a number , multiplying it by 256 for some positive integer , and searching for possible primes within the interval [256kn + 1, 256k(n + 1) \u2212 1].\u000a\u000aGiven a composite integer n, the task of providing one (or all) prime factors is referred to as factorization of n. Elliptic curve factorization is an algorithm relying on arithmetic on an elliptic curve.\u000a\u000aThe distribution of primes in the large, such as the question how many primes are smaller than a given, large threshold, is described by the prime number theorem, but no efficient formula for the n-th prime is known.\u000a\u000aThere are arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive non-primes, as for every positive integer the consecutive integers from to (inclusive) are all composite (as is divisible by for between and ).\u000a\u000aDirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, in its basic form, asserts that linear polynomials\u000a\u000awith coprime integers a and b take infinitely many prime values. Stronger forms of the theorem state that the sum of the reciprocals of these prime values diverges, and that different such polynomials with the same b have approximately the same proportions of primes.\u000a\u000aThe corresponding question for quadratic polynomials is less well-understood.\u000a\u000aThere is no known efficient formula for primes. For example, Mills' theorem and a theorem of Wright assert that there are real constants A>1 and \u03bc such that\u000a\u000aare prime for any natural number n. Here represents the floor function, i.e., largest integer not greater than the number in question. The latter formula can be shown using Bertrand's postulate (proven first by Chebyshev), which states that there always exists at least one prime number p with n < p < 2n \u2212 2, for any natural number n > 3. However, computing A or \u03bc requires the knowledge of infinitely many primes to begin with.[26] Another formula is based on Wilson's theorem and generates the number 2 many times and all other primes exactly once.\u000a\u000aThere is no non-constant polynomial, even in several variables, that takes only prime values. However, there is a set of Diophantine equations in 9 variables and one parameter with the following property: the parameter is prime if and only if the resulting system of equations has a solution over the natural numbers. This can be used to obtain a single formula with the property that all its positive values are prime.\u000a\u000aThe prime counting function \u03c0(n) is defined as the number of primes not greater than n. For example \u03c0(11) = 5, since there are five primes less than or equal to 11. There are known algorithms to compute exact values of \u03c0(n) faster than it would be possible to compute each prime up to n. The prime number theorem states that \u03c0(n) is approximately given by\u000a\u000ain the sense that the ratio of \u03c0(n) and the right hand fraction approaches 1 when n grows to infinity. This implies that the likelihood that a number less than n is prime is (approximately) inversely proportional to the number of digits in n. A more accurate estimate for \u03c0(n) is given by the offset logarithmic integral\u000a\u000aThe prime number theorem also implies estimates for the size of the n-th prime number p (i.e., p = 2, p = 3, etc.): up to a bounded factor, p grows like n log(n).[27] In particular, the prime gaps, i.e. the differences p \u2212 p of two consecutive primes, become arbitrarily large. This latter statement can also be seen in a more elementary way by noting that the sequence n! + 2, n! + 3, \u2026, n! + n (for the notation n! read factorial) consists of n \u2212 1 composite numbers, for any natural number n.\u000a\u000aAn arithmetic progression is the set of natural numbers that give the same remainder when divided by some fixed number q called modulus. For example,\u000a\u000ais an arithmetic progression modulo q = 9. Except for 3, none of these numbers is prime, since 3 + 9n = 3(1 + 3n) so that the remaining numbers in this progression are all composite. (In general terms, all prime numbers above q are of the form q#·n + m, where 0 < m < q#, and m has no prime factor \u2264 q.) Thus, the progression\u000a\u000acan have infinitely many primes only when a and q are coprime, i.e., their greatest common divisor is one. If this necessary condition is satisfied, Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions asserts that the progression contains infinitely many primes. The picture below illustrates this with q = 9: the numbers are "wrapped around" as soon as a multiple of 9 is passed. Primes are highlighted in red. The rows (=progressions) starting with a = 3, 6, or 9 contain at most one prime number. In all other rows (a = 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8) there are infinitely many prime numbers. What is more, the primes are distributed equally among those rows in the long run\u2014the density of all primes congruent a modulo 9 is 1/6.\u000a\u000aThe Green\u2013Tao theorem shows that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions consisting of primes.[28] An odd prime p is expressible as the sum of two squares, p = x2 + y2, exactly if p is congruent 1 modulo 4 (Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares).\u000a\u000agives prime numbers for 0 \u2264 n < 40,[29][30] a fact leading into deep algebraic number theory, more specifically Heegner numbers. For bigger n, it does take composite values. The Hardy-Littlewood conjecture F makes an asymptotic prediction about the density of primes among the values of quadratic polynomials (with integer coefficients a, b, and c)\u000a\u000ain terms of Li(n) and the coefficients a, b, and c. However, progress has proved hard to come by: no quadratic polynomial (with a \u2260 0) is known to take infinitely many prime values. The Ulam spiral depicts all natural numbers in a spiral-like way. Surprisingly, prime numbers cluster on certain diagonals and not others, suggesting that some quadratic polynomials take prime values more often than other ones.\u000a\u000aThe Riemann zeta function \u03b6(s) is defined as an infinite sum\u000a\u000awhere s is a complex number with real part bigger than 1. It is a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic that this sum agrees with the infinite product\u000a\u000aThe zeta function is closely related to prime numbers. For example, the aforementioned fact that there are infinitely many primes can also be seen using the zeta function: if there were only finitely many primes then \u03b6(1) would have a finite value. However, the harmonic series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... diverges (i.e., exceeds any given number), so there must be infinitely many primes. Another example of the richness of the zeta function and a glimpse of modern algebraic number theory is the following identity (Basel problem), due to Euler,\u000a\u000aThe reciprocal of \u03b6(2), 6/\u03c02, is the probability that two numbers selected at random are relatively prime.[31][32]\u000a\u000aThe unproven Riemann hypothesis, dating from 1859, states that except for s = \u22122, \u22124, ..., all zeroes of the \u03b6-function have real part equal to 1/2. The connection to prime numbers is that it essentially says that the primes are as regularly distributed as possible.[clarification needed] From a physical viewpoint, it roughly states that the irregularity in the distribution of primes only comes from random noise. From a mathematical viewpoint, it roughly states that the asymptotic distribution of primes (about x/log x of numbers less than x are primes, the prime number theorem) also holds for much shorter intervals of length about the square root of x (for intervals near x). This hypothesis is generally believed to be correct. In particular, the simplest assumption is that primes should have no significant irregularities without good reason.\u000a\u000aIn addition to the Riemann hypothesis, many more conjectures revolving about primes have been posed. Often having an elementary formulation, many of these conjectures have withstood a proof for decades: all four of Landau's problems from 1912 are still unsolved. One of them is Goldbach's conjecture, which asserts that every even integer n greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two primes. As of February 2011 , this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to n = 2 · 1017.[33] Weaker statements than this have been proven, for example Vinogradov's theorem says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes. Chen's theorem says that every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a semiprime, the product of two primes. Also, any even integer can be written as the sum of six primes.[34] The branch of number theory studying such questions is called additive number theory.\u000a\u000aOther conjectures deal with the question whether an infinity of prime numbers subject to certain constraints exists. It is conjectured that there are infinitely many Fibonacci primes[35] and infinitely many Mersenne primes, but not Fermat primes.[36] It is not known whether or not there are an infinite number of Wieferich primes and of prime Euclid numbers.\u000a\u000aA third type of conjectures concerns aspects of the distribution of primes. It is conjectured that there are infinitely many twin primes, pairs of primes with difference 2 (twin prime conjecture). Polignac's conjecture is a strengthening of that conjecture, it states that for every positive integer n, there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by 2n.[37] It is conjectured there are infinitely many primes of the form n2 + 1.[38] These conjectures are special cases of the broad Schinzel's hypothesis H. Brocard's conjecture says that there are always at least four primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2. Legendre's conjecture states that there is a prime number between n2 and (n + 1)2 for every positive integer n. It is implied by the stronger Cramér's conjecture.\u000a\u000aFor a long time, number theory in general, and the study of prime numbers in particular, was seen as the canonical example of pure mathematics, with no applications outside of the self-interest of studying the topic. In particular, number theorists such as British mathematician G. H. Hardy prided themselves on doing work that had absolutely no military significance.[39] However, this vision was shattered in the 1970s, when it was publicly announced that prime numbers could be used as the basis for the creation of public key cryptography algorithms. Prime numbers are also used for hash tables and pseudorandom number generators.\u000a\u000aSome rotor machines were designed with a different number of pins on each rotor, with the number of pins on any one rotor either prime, or coprime to the number of pins on any other rotor. This helped generate the full cycle of possible rotor positions before repeating any position.\u000a\u000aThe International Standard Book Numbers work with a check digit, which exploits the fact that 11 is a prime.\u000a\u000aModular arithmetic modifies usual arithmetic by only using the numbers\u000a\u000awhere n is a fixed natural number called modulus. Calculating sums, differences and products is done as usual, but whenever a negative number or a number greater than n \u2212 1 occurs, it gets replaced by the remainder after division by n. For instance, for n = 7, the sum 3 + 5 is 1 instead of 8, since 8 divided by 7 has remainder 1. This is referred to by saying "3 + 5 is congruent to 1 modulo 7" and is denoted\u000a\u000aSimilarly, 6 + 1 \u2261 0 (mod 7), 2 \u2212 5 \u2261 4 (mod 7), since \u22123 + 7 = 4, and 3 · 4 \u2261 5 (mod 7) as 12 has remainder 5. Standard properties of addition and multiplication familiar from the integers remain valid in modular arithmetic. In the parlance of abstract algebra, the above set of integers, which is also denoted Z/nZ, is therefore a commutative ring for any n. Division, however, is not in general possible in this setting. For example, for n = 6, the equation\u000a\u000aa solution x of which would be an analogue of 2/3, cannot be solved, as one can see by calculating 3 · 0, ..., 3 · 5 modulo 6. The distinctive feature of prime numbers is the following: division is possible in modular arithmetic if and only if n is a prime. Equivalently, n is prime if and only if all integers m satisfying 2 \u2264 m \u2264 n \u2212 1 are coprime to n, i.e. their only common divisor is one. Indeed, for n = 7, the equation\u000a\u000ahas a unique solution, x = 3. Because of this, for any prime p, Z/pZ (also denoted F ) is called a field or, more specifically, a finite field since it contains finitely many, namely p, elements.\u000a\u000aA number of theorems can be derived from inspecting F in this abstract way. For example, Fermat's little theorem, stating\u000a\u000afor any integer a not divisble by p, may be proved using these notions. This implies\u000a\u000aGiuga's conjecture says that this equation is also a sufficient condition for p to be prime. Another consequence of Fermat's little theorem is the following: if p is a prime number other than 2 and 5, 1/ is always a recurring decimal, whose period is p \u2212 1 or a divisor of p \u2212 1. The fraction 1/ expressed likewise in base q (rather than base 10) has similar effect, provided that p is not a prime factor of q. Wilson's theorem says that an integer p > 1 is prime if and only if the factorial (p \u2212 1)! + 1 is divisible by p. Moreover, an integer n > 4 is composite if and only if (n \u2212 1)! is divisible by n.\u000a\u000aMany mathematical domains make great use of prime numbers. An example from the theory of finite groups are the Sylow theorems: if G is a finite group and pn is the highest power of the prime p that divides the order of G, then G has a subgroup of order pn. Also, any group of prime order is cyclic (Lagrange's theorem).\u000a\u000aSeveral public-key cryptography algorithms, such as RSA and the Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange, are based on large prime numbers (for example 512 bit primes are frequently used for RSA and 1024 bit primes are typical for Diffie\u2013Hellman.). RSA relies on the assumption that it is much easier (i.e., more efficient) to perform the multiplication of two (large) numbers x and y than to calculate x and y (assumed coprime) if only the product xy is known. The Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange relies on the fact that there are efficient algorithms for modular exponentiation, while the reverse operation the discrete logarithm is thought to be a hard problem.\u000a\u000aInevitably, some of the numbers that occur in nature are prime. There are, however, relatively few examples of numbers that appear in nature because they are prime.\u000a\u000aOne example of the use of prime numbers in nature is as an evolutionary strategy used by cicadas of the genus Magicicada.[40] These insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas.[41] If Magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals, say every 12 years, then predators appearing every 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 years would be sure to meet them. Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas.[42] Though small, this advantage appears to have been enough to drive natural selection in favour of a prime-numbered life-cycle for these insects.\u000a\u000aThere is speculation[by whom?] that the zeros of the zeta function are connected to the energy levels of complex quantum systems.[43]\u000a\u000aThe concept of prime number is so important that it has been generalized in different ways in various branches of mathematics. Generally, "prime" indicates minimality or indecomposability, in an appropriate sense. For example, the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field F containing both 0 and 1. It is either Q or the finite field with p elements, whence the name.[44] Often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components. For example, in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots. Any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots.[45] Prime models and prime 3-manifolds are other examples of this type.\u000a\u000aPrime numbers give rise to two more general concepts that apply to elements of any commutative ring R, an algebraic structure where addition, subtraction and multiplication are defined: prime elements and irreducible elements. An element p of R is called prime element if it is neither zero nor a unit (i.e., does not have a multiplicative inverse) and satisfies the following requirement: given x and y in R such that p divides the product xy, then p divides x or y. An element is irreducible if it cannot be written as a product of two ring elements that are not units. In the ring Z of integers, the set of prime elements equals the set of irreducible elements, which is\u000a\u000aIn any ring R, any prime element is irreducible. The converse does not hold in general, but does hold for unique factorization domains.\u000a\u000aThe fundamental theorem of arithmetic continues to hold in unique factorization domains. An example of such a domain is the Gaussian integers Z[i], that is, the set of complex numbers of the form a + bi where i denotes the imaginary unit and a and b are arbitrary integers. Its prime elements are known as Gaussian primes. Not every prime (in Z) is a Gaussian prime: in the bigger ring Z[i], 2 factors into the product of the two Gaussian primes (1 + i) and (1 \u2212 i). Rational primes (i.e. prime elements in Z) of the form 4k + 3 are Gaussian primes, whereas rational primes of the form 4k + 1 are not.\u000a\u000aIn ring theory, the notion of number is generally replaced with that of ideal. Prime ideals, which generalize prime elements in the sense that the principal ideal generated by a prime element is a prime ideal, are an important tool and object of study in commutative algebra, algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry. The prime ideals of the ring of integers are the ideals (0), (2), (3), (5), (7), (11), \u2026 The fundamental theorem of arithmetic generalizes to the Lasker\u2013Noether theorem, which expresses every ideal in a Noetherian commutative ring as an intersection of primary ideals, which are the appropriate generalizations of prime powers.[46]\u000a\u000aPrime ideals are the points of algebro-geometric objects, via the notion of the spectrum of a ring.[47] Arithmetic geometry also benefits from this notion, and many concepts exist in both geometry and number theory. For example, factorization or ramification of prime ideals when lifted to an extension field, a basic problem of algebraic number theory, bears some resemblance with ramification in geometry. Such ramification questions occur even in number-theoretic questions solely concerned with integers. For example, prime ideals in the ring of integers of quadratic number fields can be used in proving quadratic reciprocity, a statement that concerns the solvability of quadratic equations\u000a\u000awhere x is an integer and p and q are (usual) prime numbers.[48] Early attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem climaxed when Kummer introduced regular primes, primes satisfying a certain requirement concerning the failure of unique factorization in the ring consisting of expressions\u000a\u000awhere a , ..., a are integers and \u03b6 is a complex number such that \u03b6p = 1.[49]\u000a\u000aValuation theory studies certain functions from a field K to the real numbers R called valuations.[50] Every such valuation yields a topology on K, and two valuations are called equivalent if they yield the same topology. A prime of K (sometimes called a place of K) is an equivalence class of valuations. For example, the p-adic valuation of a rational number q is defined to be the integer v (q), such that\u000a\u000awhere both r and s are not divisible by p. For example, v (18/7) = 2. The p-adic norm is defined as[nb 1]\u000a\u000aIn particular, this norm gets smaller when a number is multiplied by p, in sharp contrast to the usual absolute value (also referred to as the infinite prime). While completing Q (roughly, filling the gaps) with respect to the absolute value yields the field of real numbers, completing with respect to the p-adic norm |\u2212| yields the field of p-adic numbers.[51] These are essentially all possible ways to complete Q, by Ostrowski's theorem. Certain arithmetic questions related to Q or more general global fields may be transferred back and forth to the completed (or local) fields. This local-global principle again underlines the importance of primes to number theory.\u000a\u000aPrime numbers have influenced many artists and writers. The French composer Olivier Messiaen used prime numbers to create ametrical music through "natural phenomena". In works such as La Nativité du Seigneur (1935) and Quatre études de rythme (1949\u201350), he simultaneously employs motifs with lengths given by different prime numbers to create unpredictable rhythms: the primes 41, 43, 47 and 53 appear in the third étude, "Neumes rythmiques". According to Messiaen this way of composing was "inspired by the movements of nature, movements of free and unequal durations".[52]\u000a\u000aIn his science fiction novel Contact, NASA scientist Carl Sagan suggested that prime numbers could be used as a means of communicating with aliens, an idea that he had first developed informally with American astronomer Frank Drake in 1975.[53] In the novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon, the narrator arranges the sections of the story by consecutive prime numbers.[54]\u000a\u000aMany films, such as Cube, Sneakers, The Mirror Has Two Faces and A Beautiful Mind reflect a popular fascination with the mysteries of prime numbers and cryptography.[55] Prime numbers are used as a metaphor for loneliness and isolation in the Paolo Giordano novel The Solitude of Prime Numbers, in which they are portrayed as "outsiders" among integers.[56]

VMetabolism (from Greek \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 "metabolismos") is the biochemical modification of chemical compounds by living organisms and cells. In common usage, the word is often used to refer to the basal metabolic rate, the "set point" that each person has in breaking down food energy and building up their own body. In multicellular creatures like humans, its meaning encompasses the overall ingestion of food and excretion of wastes, as well as the building up of muscles and the growth of the body. In terms of the whole organism, metabolism includes the chemical conversion of ingested items other than food, like drugs and poisons (see Drug metabolism). This article describes the actual biology of metabolism at a cellular level, which explains just how those processes are carried out.\u000a\u000aMetabolism includes: (1) anabolism, in which a cell uses chemical energy and reducing power to construct complex molecules, and perform life functions such as creating cellular structure; and (2) catabolism, in which a cell breaks down complex molecules to yield the chemical energy and reducing power. Cell metabolism involves complex sequences of controlled chemical reactions called metabolic pathways. Just as the word metabolism can be used to describe processes in a whole organism, the terms "anabolism" and "catabolism" can similarly be used in this way. For example, anabolic processes can also refer to building up muscle and adding body weight, while catabolic processes can refer to the loss of muscle mass and body fat.\u000a\u000aThe first controlled experiments on human metabolism were published by Santorio Santorio in 1614 in his book Ars de statica medecina, in which he described experiments in which he weighed himself in a chair suspended from a steelyard balance (see image), before and after eating, sleeping, working, sex, fasting, depriving from drinking, and excreting. He found that by far the greatest part of the food he took in was lost from the body through perspiratio insensibilis (insensible perspiration). In medicine and the health sciences, the term "insensible losses" is still used to refer to fluids that escape the body without leaving easily-measurable traces behind.\u000a\u000aAt about the same time, Jan Baptist van Helmont made the first observations regarding photosynthesis, when he discovered that growing plants drew almost no matter from the surrounding soil. The physical source of the plant's growth was not obvious until later experiments, which delved into the process now known as photosynthesis.\u000a\u000aIn the 18th century, Joseph Priestley discovered that green plants released a substance (later found to be oxygen) that could sustain the life of a mouse in an enclosed chamber. Jan Ingenhousz extended Priestley's experiments to show that oxygen was produced when light was cast on the plant, while Jean Senebier showed that carbon dioxide was absorbed by plants during photosynthesis. In 1804, Nicolas de Saussure discovered that plant growth was the result of both the fixation of atmospheric carbon dioxide ( ) into the plant, and the incorporation of water.\u000a\u000aBetween 1854 and 1864, Louis Pasteur discovered that glucose fermentation is due to microorganisms, and, in 1897, Eduard Buchner proved that cell-free yeast extracts could also perform these reactions, and so the ability to ferment was not limited to entire living creatures (cells)- but included certain portions of their physical contents. Subsequent investigations showed that living organisms, with few exceptions, metabolize glucose using the same mechanism, namely, by a biochemical pathway that breaks down sugar.\u000a\u000aLiving things, like all things, obey the laws of thermodynamics. That means that energy and matter cannot be created from nothing; cool things always get colder rather than warmer, and each fragment of a whole are smaller than the whole itself. But, unlike inanimate things, cells and tissues are able to harness energy and matter to change in ways that give the illusion of defying those laws. A baby does grow. A walrus' body is warmer than its icy surroundings. An amoeba can divide and shortly be two amoebas, each one the same size of the original cell that split. The metabolism of the baby, the walrus, and the amoeba is responsible for all these processes. Of course, rather than defy the laws of thermodynamics, the chemical reactions that make up metabolic processes always obey them.\u000a\u000aEnzymes present in cells can catalyze a large variety of chemical reactions with exquisite specificity. Generally, enzymes are protein molecules that make reactions go faster by bringing the reactant molecules close together in just the right orientation for a chemical change to occur. Sometimes these enzymes are floating free in the cytoplasm of the cell, other times they are corralled together within a compartment of the cell, a special organelle. For example, the mitochondrion of cells contains enzymes for oxidative phosphorylation (a catabolic process). The Golgi apparatus of cells contains many of the enzymes used for protein posttranslational modification (an anabolic process).\u000a\u000aOften, the chemical reactions needed to synthesize useful cell components require energy. Chemists describe these reactions as involving a positive change in free energy. Such chemical transformations are not spontaneous, but "uphill", requiring more than just the mixing of the substrates. In these cases, specific enzymes may couple each "uphill" (non-spontaneous or energy requiring) reaction to a second, steep "downhill" (very spontaneous or energy releasing) reaction. Thus, thermodynamically favorable reactions can be used to "drive" each thermodynamically unfavorable one - such that the the overall process goes on its own, as a spontaneous series of reactions.\u000a\u000aThere is one particular energetically favourable reaction that is repeatedly used to drive "uphill" reactions in metabolism:\u000a\u000aThis reaction, the hydrolysis of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into Adenosine diphosphate and two ions, occurs often in metabolic pathways. ATP is sometimes called the "energy currency" of cells because it is used to "finance" these uphill reactions. To regenerate it for further reactions a large amount of energy is needed to recombine the products shown in the equation above. This is done by coupling the uphill synthesis of ATP to other energy-releasing reactions and is so ubiquitous that organisms can be classified according to how they derive energy for the process. Organisms can be classified as either Phototrophic or Chemotrophic.\u000a\u000aPhototrophic organisms can obtain energy from light. In these reactions, excitation of a photosynthetic reaction centre is caused by the absorption of a light photon. During the process, the reaction center loses an electron that excites (reduces) an electron acceptor, such as pheophytin, initiating a flow of electrons down an electron transport chain present in the thylakoid membrane. The energy released in the electron transfer steps serves to create a proton gradient across the membrane; its dissipation is used by ATP synthase as the energy to synthesise ATP from ADP and a phosphate anion by photophosphorylation (see Chemiosmotic hypothesis). Depending on the organism, the reaction center regains the lost electron by either recycling the excited electrons or taking one from an electron donor. In plants, a water molecule serves as the electron donor through a process called photolysis, that releases oxygen gas as a waste product.\u000a\u000aChemotrophic organisms obtain energy from chemical reactions. For example, glucose can be oxidized to pyruvate through glycolysis. This yields two molecules of ATP for each molecule of glucose, by substrate-level phosphorylation, and four electrons, which reduce two NAD+ molecules to NADH.\u000a\u000aFor glycolysis to continue, the NADH must be recycled to NAD+ by donating the electrons to an electron acceptor. Respiration is said to occur if this electron acceptor is external to the metabolism, and may be either anaerobic or aerobic. Fermentation, on the other hand, does not use an external electron acceptor: in this case, the electron acceptor is a product of glycolysis, usually pyruvate or a pyruvate derivative.\u000a\u000aAcetyl-CoA is a pivotal molecule during aerobic respiration. Acetyl-CoA is derived from pyruvate, but can also be formed through \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids or through the catabolism of amino acids, and is oxidized to CO through the Krebs cycle. The Krebs cycle releases eight electrons from each acetyl-CoA molecule, which are eventually used in aerobic organisms to reduce oxygen (terminal electron acceptor) via an electron transport chain. This is part of the process to synthesis more ATP, known as oxidative phosphorylation, and is very similar to photophosphorylation in phototrophs.\u000a\u000aReducing power is an important input into many anabolic pathways, including the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis, the biosynthesis of amino acids, and the biosynthesis of fatty acids. Reducing power is usually supplied as hydrogen equivalents carried by NADPH. Organisms can be classified according to the primary source of this reducing power as:\u000a\u000aThese organisms use organic compounds (e.g. glucose) as the primary electron source.\u000a\u000aThese organisms use inorganic compounds (e.g. Fe2+, (iron ions)) as primary electron source.\u000a\u000aIn animals, metabolism is controlled by the endocrine system through the secretion of hormones. Some hormones have anabolic actions on the body, others have mainly catabolic actions. For example, testosterone is an anabolic hormone, and synthetic steroids that produce the anabolic actions are known as anabolic steroids. Cortisol on the other hand, which is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal gland, is a catabolic hormone.\u000a\u000aTwo hormones synthesized by the pancreas, insulin and glucagon, are particularly important. Insulin is secreted when blood glucose levels are high, and it stimulates glucose uptake by muscle, glycogen synthesis, and triacylglyceride synthesis by adipose tissue (fat). It also inhibits gluconeogenesis and glycogen degradation. Glucagon is secreted when blood glucose levels are low, and its effects are opposite to those of insulin. In the liver, glucagon stimulates glycogen degradation and the absorption of gluconeogenic aminoacids, and it inhibits glycogen synthesis and promotes the release of fatty acids by adipose tissue.\u000a\u000aIn mammals and other warm blooded animals, many metabolic process are ultimately controlled by the central nervous system, which regulates the endocrine system. The central nervous system and endocrine system are influenced by the balance between the energy demands of the organism, and its energy stores (see also Hunger). For example, fat stores secrete a hormone called leptin that acts at the hypothalamus to regulate hormone secretion. The hypothalamus is also sensitive to circulating concentrations of glucose and insulin, and to body temperature. When the ambient temperature is low, the metabolic rate of an endothermic animal will increase in order to generate more body heat (thermogenesis). In animals that hibernate, the body temperature drops down enough that the basal metabolic rate is quite low, conserving energy over a winter period of inactivity.\u000a\u000aSome ectothermic animals, like reptiles, regulate their body temperature by their behavior. These "cold blooded" creatures, including lizards, snakes, and turtles, keep at an optimum body temperature by heating up in the sun (basking) and cooling down in the shade or the cool earth of a burrow. The metabolism of these animals also changes with body temperature, and explains the sluggish movements of an ectotherm in colder seasons or times of day.
